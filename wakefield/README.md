# The results obtained after a citation analysis on the Wakefield et al. retracted article

[The webpage](https://ivanhb.github.io/ret-analysis-wakefield-results/) contains the graphics and dynamic visualizations built on the results obtained after the application of a citation analysis on the Wakefield et al. retracted article.

On [the webpage](https://ivanhb.github.io/ret-analysis-wakefield-results/) we provide:

* Two images that summarize some of the values and stats we have obtained as a result of our citation analysis. One characterizes the citing entities and one characterizes the in-text citations contained in the citing entites</span></li>

* Three dynamic visualizations (LDAvis and two MTMvis) to show the results obtained after the application of a topic modeling over the abstracts of the citing entities

* Three dynamic visualizations (LDAvis and two MTMvis) to show the results obtained after the application of a topic modeling over the contexts of the in-text citations contained in the citing entities
