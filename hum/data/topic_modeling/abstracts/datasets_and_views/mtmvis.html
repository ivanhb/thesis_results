        "abstract": "by \u2018bringing in\u2019 the global dimension, this thesis aims to explain the main reasons for turkey\u2019s failure to comply with eu conditionality. existing studies in the field either look at the hardships in turkish-eu intergovernmental bargains or at the \u2018cultural mismatch\u2019 that triggers opposition in the conservative circles of both turkey and europe. such tendencies mislead many students to miss the \u2018bigger picture\u2019; in other words, the global legitimation processes underlying turkey\u2019s interactions with the eu. by introducing world polity theory, an innovative sociological institutionalist theory developed by a stanford university sociologist, john w. meyer, since the 1970s, this thesis promises a fuller analysis of the difficult relations between turkey and the eu through the study of three key sectors where eu-led reforms prove particularly problematic: foreign land ownership, ombudsmanship, and turkey\u2019s cyprus policy. benefiting from original interview and survey findings, the thesis demonstrates that the likelihood of eu-led reform depends on the extent to which it is perceived as globally legitimate in the candidate country, turkey. the main argument is that turkey-european union relations should be considered within the context of a wider global cultural environment in which they are deeply embedded and which constitute their agency. this argument is innovative in three ways. first, it adds the global context, which is severely neglected in the prevailing studies on eu-turkey relations, as a constitutive element to the analysis. second, it offers new analytical tools to rethink the eu as an \u2018organizational carrier\u2019 of world models and better explain the domestic motivations behind compliance with eu conditionality. finally, it contributes to world polity research that is increasingly criticized for having a topdown approach and lacking in-depth case studies on how world models spread.",

(studies on the identity of europe may be substantially existing in order to regulate european knowledge and to discuss the identity of europe. it is the european knowledge of the perception of the identity of europe (the name of the european union). europe) are characterized by a level relative to the degree of social variability, compared to the level of the only national member states. type of perception of european identity is very rare.we must look forward to the degree of interpretation of international differences that exists in european society, we need to initiate a great deal of attention to this international perspective. around the disparity in the perception of the identity of europe the only countries of the european union and their groups and, in principle, their data are derived from eurobarometer 73.3, which has been launched in 2010. the initiative discusses the relationship between the identity of national and regional nationals. of europe.)",

        "abstract": "this article theorizes the european-level political response to the radical right by suggesting a focus on the conceptions of politics, society and of the european union itself that inform this response. analyses of the ways in which the political mainstream relates to such movements remain under-theorized and often fall back on understandings of political action in narrow instrumental terms. instead, this article proposes an approach to this response which emphasizes the process through which shared understanding of the european political project surface. it engages with these issues by turning to ideas that emerged in relation to the rise of european fascism in the 1930s on how to mount an effective defence of democracy. the underlying social analysis that fed into such strategies, the article argues, serves as a useful framework for analysis of the contemporary european response to the radical right.",

        "abstract": "this article asks whether the indignados social movement can be seen as a counterpublic that is capable of fostering genuine forms of cosmopolitan citizenship. it is argued that via the artful use of the possibilities of digital media (for example, social networking websites, live video, blogs), the indignados social movement goes on to devise new forms of public discourse and organized protest, as well as shared ways of thinking and acting that are capable of fuelling cosmopolitan solidarity. it is suggested that the movement serves as a springboard to analyse how new forms of public communication can foster both a shared sense of european solidarity and cosmopolitan publics. looking at examples of protest camps in various european settings and their public communication, the article puts forward the claim that the movement\u2019s self-definition as leaderless, global, inclusive and non-hierarchical owes much to its performative dimension. this latter dimension is visible, for instance, in the theatricality of the protest camps, ludic forms of protest (for example, the carnivalesque use of the v for vendetta guy fawkes\u2019 mask), and forms of public debate and decision making that are underpinned by embodied practices (for example, silent gestures) as much as by the procedural legitimacy of rational\u2013critical discourse. in targeting the political and financial elites (including those associated to the eu), the performance of protest offers new insights on what it means to be a european citizen against the backdrop of the eu debt crisis, the emergence of unelected governments in italy and greece, and the so-called \u2018dictatorship of the markets\u2019. we will see that this transnational movement goes on to engender radical modes of citizen participation that while locally rooted are also powerfully shaped and informed by the creative appropriation and reinvention of a shared repertoire of european symbols, meanings and values.",

        "abstract": "the eastern islamic concept of the imaginal realm, which explains how supra- sensory realities present themselves to imaginative perception, can enrich the imagination of film-philosophy. the imaginal realm, in arabic \u2018 alam al-mithal, world of images, or \u2018alam al-khayal, imaginative world, is part of a triadic ontology of sensible, imaginal, and intelligible realms. diverging from roots shared with western thought in the concept of the imaginative faculty, the islamic imaginal realm is supra-individual and more real than matter. the imaginal realm is a radically pro- image concept, affirming the importance of poetry, art, and images in motion. as developed by the persian philosopher sadr al-d\u0131\u02c6n muhammad al-sh\u0131\u02c6ra\u02c6z\u02c6\u0131, known as mulla\u02c6 sadra\u02c6 (1571\u20131640), the imaginal realm flows and intensifies, in a process philosophy we may fruitfully compare with spinoza, leibniz, and whitehead. i sketch the genealogy of the imaginal realm and compare it to contemporary western film-philosophy. i suggest how this transcendental concept can be made immanent. finally, i draw from contemporary muslim thinkers, such as mohammed arkoun, who ground a visionary collective politics in the imaginal realm. my central example, the documentary the lebanese rocket society (2012) by joana hadjithomas and khalil joriege, exemplifies film\u2019s imaginal powers.",

        "abstract": "i use a nationally representative survey to determine whether and which americans associate personal responsibility with economic desert. philosophers actively debate this relationship, but social scientists routinely take it for granted, foisting this assumed relationship on the people they study. respondents, i find, generally want their economic fates to rest on criteria for which they are (or appear) personally responsible, but they express this belief with varying levels of conviction and with two notable exceptions. the first involves specific determinants of economic status. respondents are divided on whether individuals exert control over their intelligence, creativity, health, and educational pedigree, but they are generally comfortable with the first two affecting peoples\u2019 economic standing. the second concerns who considers personal responsibility morally relevant to economic status. neoliberals, chiefly concerned with economic growth, are significantly less insistent that individuals be personally responsible for their economic standing. same for non-white, lower income, and older respondents, and respondents from elite schools, though to a lesser degree. at best, ideal paths to economic success and ruin are moderately associated with personal agency, though many are weakly correlated. so it goes with respondents\u2019 overall correlations between perceived control over economic determinants and the ideal-importance of those factors to economic standing. researchers must look beyond their preferred philosophical dispositions and investigate justice as it is envisioned and lived by their subjects.",

        "abstract": "for millennia, adults have told children stories not only to entertain but also to impart important moral lessons to promote prosocial behaviors. many such stories contain anthropomorphized animals because it is believed that children learn from anthropomorphic stories as effectively, if not better than, from stories with human characters, and thus are more inclined to act according to the moral lessons of the stories. here we experimentally tested this belief by reading preschoolers a sharing story with either human characters or anthropomorphized animal characters. reading the human story significantly increased preschoolers' altruistic giving but reading the anthropomorphic story or a control story decreased it. thus, contrary to the common belief, realistic stories, not anthropomorphic ones, are better for promoting young children's prosocial behavior.",

        "abstract": "there is a growing body of literature linking religious attendance to prosocial behavior (pb). the main purposes of the present study were to estimate genetic and environmental influences on the frequency of religious attendance (fra) and to explore whether and how fra moderates genetic and/or environmental influences on pb. as part of the nigerian twin and sibling study, 2860 (280 monozygotic male, 417 monozygotic female, 544 dizygotic male, 699 dizygotic female, and 920 opposite-sex dizygotic) twins (mean age = 14.2 years; sd = 1.7 years; age range = 12\u201318 years) completed a questionnaire regarding fra and a pb scale. similar to the findings from western twin samples, fra showed substantial shared environmental influences of 74% (95% ci = 69%, 78%), with absence of genetic effects. the phenotypic correlation between fra and pb was modest but positive and significant (r\u00a0= .12;\u00a0p\u00a0< .01), suggesting that pb is higher among more frequent attenders than among less frequent attenders. the results of gene\u2013environment (g\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0e) interaction model-fitting analysis revealed that fra changed individual environmental experiences rather than genetic effects on pb such that while genetic variance was stable, non-shared environmental variance declined, leading the total phenotypic variance of pb to decrease with increasing levels of religious attendance.",

(b) gross domestic product (gdp) per capita moderated the relationship between national religiosity and wgi, donation money, volunteering time, and helping a stranger. in less affluent countries, religion functioned efficiently in promoting prosocial behavior. however, in economically developed countries its function may have been substituted by other factors related to social development and civilization. this study suggests that economic factors may be the solution of the religion engagement paradox.",

        "abstract": "numerous researchers have examined preferred sport leadership behaviors from both the coach and athlete perspectives (beam, serwatka, & wilson, 2004; chelladurai, & carron, 1983; freakley, czech, harris, & burdette, 2012; turman, 2013; weinburg, & gould, 2010). however, there is limited research in student-athlete personality dispositions and how those might influence student-athlete perceptions of preferred leadership behaviors. the purpose of the present study was to examine views of leadership in light of certain personality dispositions. this research examined the potential influence of optimism (abramson, et al, 2000) on qualitative descriptions of preferred leadership behaviors using the revised leadership scale for sport (zhang, & jensen, 1998) to structure the interview questions. 106 ncaa division i student- athletes in a southeastern university completed the life orientation test-revised (lot-r), the results of which were split into three groups: low optimists, middle optimists, and high optimists. the low and high groups of student-athletes were considered for the qualitative interview. there were several similarities between the two groups regarding instructive behavior, feedback behavior, relatability, coach traits, and situational actions, but there are also several differences between the two groups in how the student-athletes prefer their coach to approach them. these differences are highlighted best in the category reactive behaviors with the high optimistic theme encourages implying preference for a coach to focus on present emotions in order to attain future success while the low optimistic theme reassures athlete of ability implies the \r\n1 \r\npreference for a coach to focus on past successes in order to attain success in the present. the category coach orientation (relationship- v results/task-focused) was much more convoluted than expected following past research. all four categories and emergent themes are described in full. the results reveal a deep difference in individual student-athlete perspective according to optimism levels and potential future research in discussed further.",

        "abstract": "the purpose of this article is to present a comprehensive 25-year review of the incorporation of levels of analysis into conceptual and empirical leadership research published within\u00a0leadership quarterly\u00a0throughout its history. we assessed the population of\u00a0leadership quarterly's research (790 research articles) on four key levels of analysis-based issues: (1) explicit statement of the focal level(s) of analysis; (2) appropriate measurement given level of constructs; (3) use of a multi-level data analysis technique; and, (4) alignment of theory and data. prior reviews regarding levels of analysis incorporation into leadership research have been limited to major research domains. results revealed that while both conceptual and empirical articles only explicitly state the focal level of analysis in approximately one-third of the articles, appropriate levels-based measurement and alignment between theory and data are relatively strong areas of achievement for the articles within\u00a0leadership quarterly. multi-level data analysis techniques are used in less than one-fifth of all articles. although there is room for improvement, there is evidence that\u00a0leadership quarterly\u00a0is a premier outlet for levels-based leadership research. given the increasing complexity of organizational science with regard to groups, teams and collectives,\u00a0leadership quarterly\u00a0has an opportunity to model for organizational research on how to build and test complicated multi-level theories and models.",

        "abstract": "this article aims to describe how organizational spirituality has been dealt with in national and international research. thus, a review of literature was carried out, based on a systematic search on literature on the scopus and scielo databases. the survey revealed 551 articles, but only 118 were available as full-documents. after reading the articles, 72 were selected for analysis. from the selected articles, seven major themes were identified and are covered in this article: factors that encourage spirituality to develop in organizations; the differences between spirituality and religion; the definition/concept of organizational spirituality; the benefits of spirituality for organizations; the dimensions of spirituality in organizations; the values of spirituality in organizations, and ways of identifying/measuring spirituality in organizations. in general, it was found that the theme of organizational spirituality is gaining momentum among academics and managers and can no longer be ignored. although research performed until now has provided encouraging results, more research is required, including empirical research, in order to elucidate and consolidate an understanding of the theme, as well as its importance for people and organizations.",

        "abstract": "prominent military figures, both contemporary and historical have, through both personal example and their promotion of critical literacy initiatives, emphasised the role of professional reading in the development of the professional wisdom that underpins effective military leadership. while biographical studies hint at a connection between the extracurricular reading habits of notable military figures and the development of their professional wisdom, the majority of studies on military leadership development focus either through the context of experience or on development through the medium of formal educational programmes. considering the time and resources invested in formal educational programmes, and the highly incremental nature of self-development that makes its utility difficult to measure, it is understandable but not acceptable that continuous, career-long self- development through professional reading receives scant attention. \r\nusing a hermeneutically derived conceptual framework as an analytical tool, this research explores the intellectual component of military leadership, as embodied in the idea of the warrior-scholar, and the role the phenomena of reading, text, and canon, play in the development of the cognitive skills \u2013 critical, creative, and strategic thinking \u2013 necessary for successful leadership in complex institutions and environments. \r\nthe research seeks to contribute original insights into the role that professional reading actually plays in the intellectual development of military leaders. the research also seeks to determine the extent to which a military canon that embodies professional military wisdom exists, and the relationship that this canon might have on the development of military leaders in the contemporary environment. \r\nthe research was conducted through an engagement with literatures in multiple disciplines and 18 open-ended in-depth research interviews with 24 emerging and established military \r\n2 \r\nleaders, and defence academics, in new zealand, australia, malaysia, singapore, the united kingdom, canada, israel and the united states on the role reading plays in their professional development. data have been analysed through literature mapping and the deployment of theme discovery and interpretation-centred analysis methods. \r\nin particular, this thesis has examined the artefact of the professional military reading list as used across nations and individual armed services as a component of contemporary professional military education for commissioned and non-commissioned officers at tactical, operational and strategic leadership levels. \r\nthe research has confirmed the utility of the reading list approach as a means of promoting professional reading, particularly to assist officers: \r\nprepare for a posting or campaign \u2028\r\nprepare for formal professional military education courses \u2028\r\naid developmental activities towards promotion \u2028\r\nbroaden general knowledge, and \u2028\r\ncultivate professional military knowledge in breadth and depth. \u2028the research has found that reading lists are syllabi for the informal mode of professional military education, particularly to supplement the study, in breadth and depth, of military history, strategy and doctrine, the art of war, and leadership in command. the research has also examined the construction and implementation of the reading lists and developed twenty principles for the development of reading lists for practical use by militaries globally. \u2028the research has critically engaged with canon as a concept. while it has not found that the canon concept in its \u2018pure\u2019 form as understood in literature studies can be usefully applied to \u2028\r\n3 \r\nmilitary education, a set of core texts have been identified as being highly valued by militaries globally for the education of officers. \r\nalthough the research did not seek to prove the link between reading and the development of military leaders, such an approach being inconsistent with the methodological lens adopted, the research does however indicate that professional reading in breadth and depth is as important a component in the development of military wisdom as is training, experience, and formal education.",

        "abstract": "the appropriate way to define and measure ethical leadership has been a source of conceptual confusion in the leadership literature. different measures have been developed, but they all have limitations. some questionnaires are missing key indicators of ethical leadership, or they include behaviors that do not seem directly relevant. in this study, the authors assess the validity of a new questionnaire for measuring essential aspects of ethical leadership independently of other types of leader behavior. the research also examines how ethical leadership is related to leader\u2013member exchange and work unit performance. although the primary purpose of these analyses is to assess criterion-related validity for the new questionnaire, the results help answer important questions about the benefits of ethical leadership. the authors found that ethical leadership makes a small but significant contribution to the explanation of leader\u2013member exchange and managerial effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "purpose\r\nthe purpose of this paper is to examine the potentials of spiritual leadership in maximizing the triple bottom line (tbl) (people, planet, and the profit) of the telecommunication industry in malaysia. the research was conducted as a quantitative study based on the sem smart-pls on four telecommunication organizations in malaysia that represent the malaysian telecommunication industry. the research was intended to prove that organizations can still develop a business model that adopts and adapts to spiritual, ethical, and moral leadership style as well as guarantees employees\u2019 well-being, organizational sustainability, and social responsibility without sacrificing its profitability by acknowledging the spiritual impact on management and employees\u2019 performance.\r\ndesign/methodology/approach\r\nthe research was conducted using the spiritual leadership survey developed by louis w. fry (2010) called the spiritual leadership balance scorecard that measured the spiritual leadership dimensions, spiritual well-being against the measure for tbl of productivity, organizational commitment, and life satisfaction (fry and altman, 2013; fry\u00a0et al., 2010). a set of questionnaire was developed that combines prior established instruments, and sent to 140 employees working in the telecommunication organizations in malaysia on a purposive sampling method, based on the sem-pls approach (hair, 2010).\r\nfindings\r\nthe research has proven that organizations can still boosts its profitability by adopting to business models that acknowledge the importance of human values, the emotional part and the spiritual part. as the research has surprisingly proven that by having spiritual leaders on premise, a telecommunication provider will be able to awaken a sense that one\u2019s life has meaning, not just to his or her own selves, but to the community at large as well. the spiritual leaders are able to influence a sense that one\u2019s life has meaning and wanting to make differences in others life as when the employees, through the inner life, hope and faith given by the leaders in striving for the visions with altruistic love.\r\nresearch limitations/implications\r\nthe limitation of the study to include cultural values as a contributing factor to the spiritual values could have been an avenue for future research on the influence of spiritual leadership on the tbl of such organizations. as such, this may be the reason why the employees of the telecommunication organizations in malaysia are scoring low in developing a sense of calling, when due to the culture of being malaysian, scoring high in hofstede\u2019s theory of culture on uncertainty avoidance and power distance (ting and ying, 2013).\r\npractical implications\r\nadapting to spiritual leadership facilitate employee engagement by tackling the soft part of human resources, the inner sense. the inner sense is able to awaken the conscience and compassion, which can lead to effective working attitude, commitment, and engagement as reciprocal effects.\r\nsocial implications\r\nspiritual leadership is the agenda to win back employees\u2019 trust and confidence to the organizations which have proven to cause mishap in the current economic trend. the values brought by spiritual leadership are able to balance between work and life and in fulfilling the human needs to feel appreciated, regarded and respected and that being human, the urge to be connected to a community is unavoidable and to feel happy with what they are doing is the food for the soul.\r\noriginality/value\r\nno study has ever been conducted in the malaysian context with regard to spiritual leadership and at the same time employing the balance scorecard developed academically into a practical context. on the other hand, the study also proved to be the first with regard to scientifically proving the importance of spiritual values to leadership style, workplace experience as well as to organizational performance in terms of job satisfaction, productivity, and satisfaction in life.",

        "abstract": "in recent years, a number of new, values\u2010based, or ideological models focusing on leader behavior have been proposed. these models include authentic, servant, character\u2010based, ethical, spiritual, and aesthetic leadership. in the present effort, we argue that these models, despite some differences in key dimensions, are tied together by a focus on moral behavior. the available evidence indicates that these models have only modest predictive power with respect to organizational performance criteria. more centrally, we argue that tests of these models are characterized by significant methodological problems with respect to both measurement and control. moreover, these models suffer from some serious substantive concerns, including the explicit confounding of leadership and morality, discounting of system impacts, inappropriate assumptions about follower needs, and inappropriate scientific inferences. these models also fail to provide viable new approaches for leader development. we conclude that caution must be exercised when these models are employed as a basis for understanding leadership. copyright \u00a9 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.",

        "abstract": "this article examines the effects of transformational leadership of supervisors and the sense of calling on job burnout among special education teachers. a total of 256 special education teachers completed the maslach burnout inventory and rated their supervisors on the multifactor leadership questionnaire. the results reveal that transformational leadership was negatively related to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and positively related to personal accomplishment. moreover, the present study indicates that the relationship between transformational leadership and teachers\u2019 burnout was mediated by the sense of calling. this finding suggests that transformational leadership indirectly affects job burnout by developing a sense of calling in followers or helping them find meaning and purpose in their experiences through transformational leadership behaviors, which can ultimately protect followers from being exposed to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and enhance the feeling of personal accomplishment.",

        "abstract": "this thesis has three primary objectives: first, to review the spirituality and sustainable procurement literature and address the gap that exists; second, to investigate the relationship between spirituality and sustainable procurement within the australian higher education sector; and third, to investigate the demographic profile of this sector and its relationship with spirituality and sustainable procurement. \r\nthe workplace spirituality literature is gaining momentum; however, its existence within the australian higher education sector is unnoticed. similarly, procurement studies that are predominantly studied within europe are patchy and are inconsistent within the australian context (mcmurray et al., 2009). to date, procurement studies are non-existent in the australian higher education sector. the concepts of spirituality and sustainable procurement are still in their infancy, emerging and multidisciplinary; and the business and management literature contains no investigation of their relationship. consequently, this thesis provides an original contribution to the existing literature. \r\nan empirical study of 224 procurement professionals working within the australian higher education sector confirms the relationship between spirituality and sustainable procurement. for example, dimension one of spirituality \u2013 larger context \u2013 is correlated with sustainable procurement dimensions such as environment (r=0.342, p=0.000), human rights (r=0.243, p=0.000) and philanthropy (r=0.200, p=0.003). additionally, the emergent data confirms that there is a negative relationship between spirituality and sustainable procurement at the dimension level. \r\n1 \r\nthis quantitative thesis has a response rate of 44.50% and stands on a pre-test, a pilot study and the main study. the survey uses two highly recognised and reputed scales: the human spirituality scale (wheat, 1991) which measures spirituality; and the purchasing social responsibility scale (carter & jennings, 2004) which quantifies the procurement behaviour of the population frame, comprising procurement executives, procurement directors, senior procurement managers and procurement assistants. the thesis uses pearson correlation, t-test, and analysis of variance (anova) to investigate the research questions and is guided by the conceptual framework of spillover theory. \r\nby addressing the relationship between spirituality and sustainable procurement in the australian higher education sector, this thesis is one of the first empirical studies undertaken to investigate the relatively new and under-researched phenomenon of spirituality and its relationship with sustainable procurement. thus, the thesis builds a platform for future research. the findings of the thesis have significant implications for modern organisations. spirituality can be considered as a tool, which facilitates the sustainable and ethical behaviour within the workplace (gupta et al., 2012).",

        "abstract": "spiritual leadership is an emerging holistic leadership construct that has been validated in several cultures outside of north america. however, these studies have failed to examine the underlying relationship of embedded cultural values and spiritual leadership. to address this problem, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of confucian values to spiritual leadership within a south korean context. data was gathered through surveys from three firms within korea\u2019s financial sector. factor analysis of confucian values found a two-factor solution, including social order and harmony. harmony was excluded from analysis due to poor inter-scale correlations. social order showed a positive, significant relationship to spiritual leadership variables, suggesting confucian values comprise a portion of the inner life of koreans and support the emergence of spiritual leadership within a confucian context. the results of this study increase our understanding of the importance of emic manifestations of leadership theory in generalizing western leadership theories to outside cultures.",

        "abstract": "in this paper, we examine the relationship between various christian denominations and attitude and behavior regarding consumption of socially responsible (sr) products. literature on the relationship between religiosity and pro-social behavior has shown that religiosity strengthens positive attitudes towards pro-social behavior, but does not affect social behavior itself. this seems to contradict the theory of planned behavior that predicts that attitude fosters behavior. one would therefore expect that if religiosity encourages attitude towards sr products, it would also increase the demand for them. we test this hypothesis for four affiliations (non-religious, catholic, orthodox protestant, and other protestant) on a sample of 997 dutch consumers, using structural equation modeling. we find that christian religiosity, indeed, increases positive attitude towards sr products, except for the orthodox protestant affiliation. in accordance with the theory of planned behavior, attitude is found to increase the demand for sr products. we find no evidence of hypocrisy (in the sense that religiosity increases pro-social attitude without affecting behavior in the case of sr products) for any of the christian denominations.",

        "abstract": "the focus of many disciplines on cooperation as a strategy for effective societal functioning stimulates continuing debate on altruism generally and altruistic leadership more specifically. theoretical articulation of the concept of altruistic leadership is limited, with most leadership scholars focusing on self-sacrificial behaviours, rather than leaders\u2019 motivational state. this thesis draws on the social science literature to address the question of the nature of altruistic leadership and its effects, using a mixed-method approach. \r\na new measure of altruistic leadership was developed using an exploratory survey of 806 managers and 1,049 employees, and qualitative interviews with leader-follower pairs eliciting 35 critical incidents describing altruistic leadership. validity and reliability of the scale were then tested in a survey of a matched sample of 184 managers and 532 employees working in four organisations in the uk financial services sector. \r\nthe contribution of this research to the field is twofold. first, two new dimensions of the altruistic leadership construct \u2013 expectation to bear costs of self-sacrifice and empathic concern \u2013 were revealed. additionally, altruistic leadership predicted follower perceptions of leader effectiveness, organisational climate and support for creativity above the variance explained by transformational and servant leadership. followers reported the least positive leadership outcomes if their leaders considerably overestimated how altruistic they were, compared to the ratings given to them by followers. \r\ntheoretically, the thesis enhances our understanding of the nature and effects of altruistic leadership, raising important questions about its role in the work of \r\ni \r\norganisations. this insight could act as a foundation for further studies of altruistic motivation of leaders in experimental settings. the scale is also practically useful as a tool for leader recruitment, development, and self-reflection. future studies should continue applying this scale across a range of organisational settings to examine how altruistic leadership is expressed.",

        "abstract": "in an altering world of work where change is inevitable, and with the vast growth of a technological era unknown to mankind and which leaves the human factor behind, there is an outcry for leaders leading by example. leaders today have a responsibility towards their followers by leading with their hearts, souls and minds, whilst intrinsically motivating their followers. spiritual leaders are individuals who live by their values, ethics and attitudes, who intrinsically motivate themselves as well as their followers, whilst instilling a sense of belonging and membership in the organisation. when a leader demonstrates these qualities, it increases the psychological wellbeing, productivity and morale of the employee, adding towards the triple bottom-line of people, planet and profit, whilst at the same time reducing absenteeism. \r\nthe objective of this study was to develop and validate a spiritual leadership questionnaire in the south african context. a quantitative, random probability sampling survey design was utilised in construction organisations in the gauteng and northern cape provinces, reaching a sample size of 221 participants. by making use and adapting the spiritual leadership theory questionnaire, the spirituality scale, the religious involvement questionnaire and the meaning in life questionnaire, a biographical questionnaire was used to develop the spiritual leadership questionnaire on a 4-point likert scale. participation was completely voluntary. the confirmatory factor analysis was used to verify whether the constructs measured the latent variable of spiritual leadership, while structural equation modelling with the application on the mplus program was used to confirm the relationships between the constructs, and to determine the validity and reliability of the latent variables. acceptable item reliability was found in a three-factor model, namely spirituality, vision/hope/faith, and altruism. \r\nthe results indicated practical and statistically significant relationships between the latent variable spiritual leadership and the constructs spirituality, vision/hope/faith and altruism.",

        "abstract": "background: spiritual leadership has recently become the focus of attention for policy makers and top managers in iran, espe- cially in the health system. due to the lack of culturally and academically accepted scales in iran for measuring spiritual leadership, localization of a foreign scale in this field is necessary.\u2028objectives: this study aimed at investigating the validity and reliability of the persian version of fry\u2019s spiritual leadership question- naire (slq) among iranian nurses. \r\nmethods: the present cross sectional methodological research was conducted during year 2016. participants were 400 nurses work- ing in teaching hospitals affiliated to 3 universities of medical sciences in tehran, iran, who were selected using stratified sampling. a standard forward-backward translation procedure according to wild et al. (2005) was used to translate the english version of the slq to persian. the psychometric evaluation processes were achieved by face, content, and construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis). reliability was examined using test-retest and cronbach\u2019s alpha for internal consistency reliability. \r\nresults: the slq showed good content validity (cvi = 0.94) ranging from 0.79 to 0.94 for each of the items. construct validity evaluation by confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) led to extraction of 8 factors from data was confirmed with acceptable values (factor- loading values ranged from 0.32 to 0.95). the original model was presented and incorporated in the cfa, indicating an acceptable fit for the model (root mean square error of approximation (rmsea) = 0.08; comparative fit index (cfi) = 0.91; normed fit index (nfi) = 0.90; and incremental fit index (ifi) = 0.95). cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient for the total scale was 0.94 and for each component ranged from 0.71 to 0.86, indicating good internal consistency, and the intraclass correlation coefficients (icc = 0.92) showed good test-retest reliability. \r\nconclusions: the persian version of fry\u2019s spiritual leadership questionnaire has acceptable psychometric properties for measuring spiritual leadership style of iranian nurse managers and helps detect and predict the extent and scope of the application of this new type of leadership to improve organizational outcomes.",

        "abstract": "current leadership models have been unable to develop leaders who are capable of successfully addressing organisational challenges such as the unethical conduct, poor performance and low morale in the south african public service. literature suggesting that spiritual leadership may improve organisational performance is emerging. the purpose of this study is to propose and present an integrated spiritual leadership (isl) model that is relevant to the south african public service and which can address burgeoning organisational challenges. \r\nin order to realise this research purpose, the study examined theoretical perspectives pertaining to spirituality, spiritual leadership and workplace spirituality. after leadership theories within the traditional and spiritual paradigms had been discussed and compared, spiritual leadership emerged as a comprehensive leadership theory. the literature on spiritual leadership also examines empirical evidence showing the way in which spiritual leadership may enhance organisational performance. the analysis of spiritual leadership models exposed a gap in the literature and highlighted the dearth of spiritual leadership research in the african and, especially, in the south african context. \r\nthe development of the isl model was based on a comparative analysis of the nine published leadership models of the following researchers and which are premised on spiritual leadership principles \u2013 danah zohar and ian marshall, kevin cashman, stephen covey, gilbert fairholm, the memorial hermann, louis fry, jeffry ferguson and john milliman, margaret benefiel, and sangeeta parameshwar. \r\nthe isl model comprises three core levels, namely, the spiritual leadership, team and organisational levels. these levels are all interconnected and aligned. the spiritual leadership level is characterised by four key attributes, namely, higher purpose and vision, core positive values, application of \r\n\r\nii \r\npersonal intelligences and changing from the inside out. in terms of the public service the three levels of the isl model may influence individual, team and organisational outcomes by promoting the effective and efficient expenditure of public funds, improved service delivery and increased employee well-being. \r\nhowever, in view of the fact that the model was based on western international models it was necessary to establish the relevance of the isl model within the south african public service context. this study was situated in the national and provincial government departments in the south african public service. a qualitative, phenomenological study was conducted to ascertain the deep, richly textured perceptions regarding the relevance of the isl model as regards the public service. in-depth interviews with 22 respondents, including public service managers, service providers and students of spiritual leadership training, were conducted in order to garner their opinions about the isl model. in addition, a quantitative survey was conducted to determine the extent to which the respondents perceived the isl model\u2019s constructs to be relevant for public service managers. the survey was completed by 233 public service managers from public service departments in both provincial and national government departments. \r\nboth the survey and the interview respondents perceive the isl model to be relevant for public service managers. however, the findings are relevant for gauteng public service departments only as the data collected were not sufficiently representative of all the provinces in south africa. many of the respondents were of the opinion that managers who embrace and model spiritual leadership principles such as higher purpose and core positive values are well equipped to overcome organisational challenges. however, although there was general agreement as regards the constructs of the isl model, there was no conclusive agreement on the ranking of the personal intelligences.1 a lack of technical competence influenced the survey participants to prioritise iq above the other intelligences, whilst the interview \r\n1 for the purposes of this study, mental intelligence (iq), emotional intelligence (eq), spiritual intelligence (sq) and physical intelligence (pq) are deemed to be personal intelligences. \r\n\r\niii \r\nrespondents rated spiritual intelligence (sq) as the highest form of intelligence. \r\nthe study recommends that a comprehensive approach is required if the isl model is to be implemented successfully and in a sustainable way. it emerged that if senior managers were to endorse and promote the isl model, this may result in the model being implemented more successfully. a specialised unit should continuously promote and monitor the realisation of the relevant department\u2019s purpose and values. relevant stakeholders should be involved to ensure widespread acceptance and endorsement, while the organisational strategy, systems, structure and culture should be aligned to the purpose, values and principles of the isl model in order to promote organisational performance and employee well-being. in addition, service providers who develop the isl model into a training and development intervention should foster deep learning so that public service leaders and managers fully embrace and internalise the principles of the isl model. \r\nfinally, this study recommended future research. a follow-up study should be conducted to determine the relevance of this isl model as regards all the provinces in the country as well as local government. in addition, a longitudinal study is recommended to determine the impact of the implementation of the isl model on the south african public service.",

        "abstract": "one of the main challenges of contemporary society is its incessant focus on developing individuality and personal objectives. a shift in paradigm will remove the dominant logic paradigm which impedes holistic development that is necessary for spiritual development to occur. a balanced society requires two perspectives, namely, the materialistic and the humanistic. widespread materialism characterizes the dominant system, is associated with that which is rational, visible and tangible. in direct contrast, the humanistic perspective is uniquely concerned with values, beliefs and feelings. humanism is only visible through the inner self and felt through the goodness of the heart; it is based on that which is associated with emotions, the spiritual and the inner conscience. education is an instrument for developing society. to educate is an art and not simply the performance of a task, it is to liberate the learner for life and thereby giving the learner meaning for existence. the shift in paradigm also takes into account a holistic model of spiritual leadership. this chapter will present a critique on extant literature and emphasize the humanizing aspect of education development that contributes to a more humane workplace enriched with collective leadership, compassion, respect, enriched with emotional, spiritual and social awareness as well as wellbeing.",

        "abstract": "this study was designed to validate fry's (2003) model of spiritual leadership within the confucian context of south korea and establish a baseline for the model in korea's financial sector. spiritual leadership is an emerging, holistic model of leadership that encapsulates the relationships of leaders, followers, organizational culture, and organizational outcomes. however, while the theory has been extensively tested in individualistic cultural contexts, validation of the theory in collectivist cultures such as korea has only recently been pursued. the study examined the emergence of spiritual leadership values and the relationship of these values on organizational commitment and productivity, as mediated by the spiritual survival variables of calling and membership through structural equation modeling. survey data were collected from a south korean financial services company with strong confucian values. the results of this study supported the universality of fry's (2003) spiritual leadership model in a confucian context, despite high job uncertainties facing participants. measures of reliability and validity were above adequate levels and fell within the range of previous studies. also, goodness-of-fit measures such as nnfi and cfi were all highly significant (p < .001) and above the .95 level. hence, a baseline for future research in korea's financial sector was established. the study recommends the need to explore the positive and negative aspects of confucianism as it relates to (a) the emergence of spiritual leadership and (b) group-level analysis of spiritual leadership. notably, the results suggest that confucian values can positively contribute to organizational outcomes through collective membership, but negatively through weak empowerment, based on the degree of reciprocal trust and loyalty between leaders and followers. additionally, the lower mean scores of spiritual leadership values in this study as compared to previous studies suggest that among other possibilities, the potential weakening of leader-follower relationships during times of uncertainty and crisis can upend the strengths of spiritual leadership. future longitudinal studies are needed to more deeply examine the relationship of job uncertainties on spiritual leadership.",

        "abstract": "ventilation systems are critically important components of many public buildings and workspaces. proper ventilation is often crucial for preventing accidents, such as explosions in mines and avoiding health issues, for example, through long-term exposure to harmful respirable matter. validation and maintenance of ventilation systems is thus of key interest for plant operators and authorities. however, methods for ventilation characterization, which allow us to monitor whether the ventilation system in place works as desired, hardly exist. this article addresses the critical challenge of ventilation characterization\u2014measuring and modelling air flow at micro-scales\u2014that is, creating a high-resolution model of wind speed and direction from airflow measurements. models of the near-surface micro-scale flow fields are not only useful for ventilation characterization, but they also provide critical information for planning energy-efficient paths for aerial robots and many applications in mobile robot olfaction. in this article we propose a heterogeneous measurement system composed of static, continuously sampling sensing nodes, complemented by localized measurements, collected during occasional sensing missions with a mobile robot. we introduce a novel, data-driven, multi-domain airflow modelling algorithm that estimates (1) fields of posterior distributions over wind direction and speed (\u201cventilation maps\u201d, spatial domain); (2) sets of ventilation calendars that capture the evolution of important airflow characteristics at measurement positions (temporal domain); and (3) a frequency domain analysis that can reveal periodic changes of airflow in the environment. the ventilation map and the ventilation calendars make use of an improved estimation pipeline that incorporates a wind sensor model and a transition model to better filter out sporadic, noisy airflow changes. these sudden changes may originate from turbulence or irregular activity in the surveyed environment and can, therefore, disturb modelling of the relevant airflow patterns. we tested the proposed multi-domain airflow modelling approach with simulated data and with experiments in a semi-controlled environment and present results that verify the accuracy of our approach and its sensitivity to different turbulence levels and other disturbances. finally, we deployed the proposed system in two different real-world industrial environments (foundry halls) with different ventilation regimes for three weeks during full operation. since airflow ground truth cannot be obtained, we present a qualitative discussion of the generated airflow models with plant operators, who concluded that the computed models accurately depicted the expected airflow patterns and are useful to understand how pollutants spread in the work environment. this analysis may then provide the basis for decisions about corrective actions to avoid long-term exposure of workers to harmful respirable matter.",

        "abstract": "considering the popularity of social media, user familiarity with the interfaces and workflows can be advantageous in a learning context. the pedagogic implementation of social media in contemporary design studios might help improve the efficiency of studio critiques, peer interactions, and the homogenous distribution of the course load throughout the semester. in this study, the effectiveness of traditional and social media-based design studio courses are investigated and compared. the sample group involved 75 fourth-year graphic design students enrolled in the \u201cexhibiting and exhibition graphics\u201d course, which was divided into treatment and control groups. for the treatment group, the studio process was performed solely on facebook, and all interactions were kept strictly online. a traditional studio process was employed for the control group. these two processes were evaluated from the students' point of view (i.e., students' opinions and experiences) and from the instructors' point of view (i.e., a panel evaluation of the submitted works). findings show that ease of communication, unlimited exposure to peer progress, and archiving and backtracking capabilities attained through social media use had positive effects on student success. contrary to expectations, peer plagiarism and pedagogical lurking did not negatively affect students' performances.",

        "abstract": "background design critique in an educational setting is a communicative interaction between an instructor and students, sometimes with invited professionals through formal and informal feedback. numerous design educators have investigated how students perceive the learning benefits of critiquing. although education researchers have found that self-efficacy is one of the key factors in academic performance, researchers in design education rarely conducted studies on how self-efficacy influences students\u2019 grades as academic outcomes. thus, in this paper, we aim to quantitatively investigate how efficacies in design education relate with academic outcomes and students\u2019 satisfaction from various aspects. methods to find the relationship between efficacy in design studios and grades in design projects, we used three scales developed by gaffney: critique self-efficacy, studio self-efficacy, and design communication competence. we surveyed forty-four design students at k university from may 2016 to june 2016. an spss statistics software was used to analyze the survey results. to conduct this analysis, we used bivariate correlation analysis, multiple linear regression analysis, and factor analysis. result first, students\u2019 efficacy predicted their anticipated grades, but not their final letter grades. in contrast, final letter grades are marginally correlated with studio self-efficacy. second, satisfaction in critique activities positively correlates with critique self-efficacy, studio self-efficacy, and design communication competence. however, this satisfaction did not predict final letter grades either. lastly, satisfaction with final critique was more strongly correlated with both anticipated letter grades and final letter grades than satisfaction with team critique. conclusion this study would help korean design educators who are utilizing a critiquing method to understand their students\u2019 efficacy and competence and how the factors relate with academic outcome.",

        "abstract": "the discovery that cancer may be caused by viruses occurred in the early twentieth century, a time when the very concept of viruses as we understand it today was in a considerable state of flux. although certain features were agreed upon, viruses, more commonly referred to as \u2018filterable viruses\u2019 were not considered much different from other microbes such as bacteria except for their extremely small size, which rendered them ultramicroscopic and filterable. for a long time, in fact, viruses were defined rather by what they were\u00a0not\u00a0and what they could\u00a0not\u00a0do, rather than any known properties that set them apart from other microbes. consequently when peyton rous suggested in 1912 that the causative agent of a transmissible sarcoma tumor of chickens was a virus, the medical research community was reluctant to accept his assessment on the grounds that cancer was not infectious and was caused by a physiological change within the cells. this difference in the bacteriological and physiological styles of thinking appears to have been prevalent in the wider research community, for when in 1917 felix d'herelle suggested that a transmissible lysis in bacteria, which he called bacteriophagy, was caused by a virus, his ideas were also opposed on similar grounds. it was not until the 1950s when when andr\u00e9 lwoff explained the phenomenon of lysogeny through his prophage hypothesis that the viral identities of the sarcoma-inducing agent and the bacteriophages were accepted. this paper examines the trajectories of the curiously parallel histories of the cancer viruses and highlights the similarities and differences between the ways in which prevailing ideas about the nature of viruses, heredity and infection drove researchers from disparate disciplines and geographic locations to develop their ideas and achieve some consensus about the nature of cancer viruses and bacteriophages.",

        "abstract": "this research examines the way in which the collective memory of the 1990s conflict in bosnia-herzegovina has been established and preserved at the memorial to genocide at srebrenica. based on extensive fieldwork at the site and in other regions of bosnia-herzegovina, the study explores the ways in which gender is represented at srebrenica in the narratives and texts that commemorate serbian aggression against bosnian muslim populations. within the structures of memory that srebrenica represents, the findings reveal the ways in which fathers and sons are recalled as victims of serbian genocide and the importance of maternal tropes of memory for post-war nation building. furthermore, the study reveals the absence of a rape discourse in the memorialization of war and genocide in bosnia-herzegovina and the challenges of commemorating sexual atrocities in the aftermath of mass trauma. the work that is presented here contributes to the emerging literature on gender and collective memory and the ways in which women\u2019s experiences are represented in structures of memorialization.",

        "abstract": "has the trauma of september 11th made us forget all the tragedies that preceded it? has it made us forget the war in the former yugoslavia that, this time 10 years ago, was at its height in bosnia? or the genocide in rwanda, in which samantha power shows in her excellent book that the united states did all it could at the time to block an international intervention?1 have we also forgotten the tens of thousands of deaths in algeria, timor, colombia, sierra leone or chechnya? the places in which violence has piled fury upon fury are too many to name. have these conflicts disappeared from our intellectual horizon because we have now limited ourselves to considering the world uniquely on the basis of the categories of terrorism and the just war? \r\nagainst this dominant tendency, this article attempts to renew reflection on some of these contemporary conflicts by focusing the analysis on the processes of extreme violence that characterize them and whose most spectacular and enigmatic manifestation is that of massacre. there are at least three reasons why this appears to be in need of analysis. the first is based on the very definition of massacre, as a form of action that is most often collective and aimed at destroying those who are not fighters but rather civilians, men, women, children and unarmed soldiers. therefore, the question returns perpetually: why kill individuals perceived to be innocent or unable to defend themselves? the second regards the fact that the victims, far from being unknown to their torturers, often belong to the same community or village. this sudden descent into massacre between individuals that may have enjoyed good neighbourly relations for a period of years is stupefying. massacre, understood here as a practice of proximity between executioner and victim, is often accompanied by atrocities that defy comprehension. such acts are staggering to the \u201caverage\u201d imagination. \r\nit would be impossible to suggest definitive analyses of these phenomena. nevertheless, this text has the ambition of attempting to demonstrate the usefulness of a comparative reflection on massacre. its aim is to go beyond case studies, or rather the presentation of the best of such studies, in order to better understand the processes that lead to the act of massacre. to this end, the analysis runs along two main lines. an historical grounding: it would in effect be difficult to attempt to understand the massacres of the 1990s without taking into account the history of massacre in the twentieth century, including those known as genocides.2 trans-disciplinary openness: the phenomenon of massacre is in itself so complex that it calls for the contributions of several disciplines, particularly sociology, anthropology and psychology. what follows attests to this. in sum, the aim of this study is to show how the social sciences may contribute to developing a comparative reflection on this subject, which could be thought of as a vocabulary of massacre and genocide.",

        "abstract": "by analytically decoupling war and violence, this book explores the causes and dynamics of violence in civil war. against prevailing views that such violence is either the product of impenetrable madness or a simple way to achieve strategic objectives, the book demonstrates that the logic of violence in civil war has much less to do with collective emotions, ideologies, cultures, or \u201cgreed and grievance\u201d than currently believed. stathis kalyvas distinguishes between indis- criminate and selective violence and specifies a novel theory of selective violence: it is jointly produced by political actors seeking information and indi- vidual noncombatants trying to avoid the worst but also grabbing what oppor- tunities their predicament affords them. violence is not a simple reflection of the optimal strategy of its users; its profoundly interactive character defeats sim- ple maximization logics while producing surprising outcomes, such as relative nonviolence in the \u201cfrontlines\u201d of civil war. civil war offers irresistible opportu- nities to those who are not naturally bloodthirsty and abhor direct involvement in violence. the manipulation of political organizations by local actors wishing to harm their rivals signals a process of privatization of political violence rather than the more commonly thought politicization of private life. seen from this perspective, violence is a process taking place because of human aversion rather than a predisposition toward homicidal violence, which helps explain the para- dox of the explosion of violence in social contexts characterized by high levels of interpersonal contact, exchange, and even trust. hence, individual behavior in civil war should be interpreted less as an instance of social anomie and more as a perverse manifestation of abundant social capital. finally, kalyvas elucidates the oft-noted disjunction between action on the ground and discourse at the top by showing that local fragmentation and local cleavages are a central rather than peripheral aspect of civil wars.",

        "abstract": "the research is the first that highlights the results of a study of the military invasion by the russian federation into ukraine in 2014 on the life and professional activity of geographers of ukraine. the study was initiated by the national committee of geographers of ukraine. it indicates non-compliance with international agreements on the inviolability of borders and the territorial integrity of states. the results obtained by the special questionnaires distributed among the members of the ukrainian geographic society living in different regions of ukraine, revealed important negative effects of the invasion on the professional activity of geographers of the state, on their relations with specialists from russia, crimea and those who remained in the occupied territories. the study also showed the deterioration of their everyday and family life, and changes in the orientation of further creative relations with geographers of neighboring states. the findings of the study indicate that the invasion of military formations in ukraine led to: - radical changes in the professional life of all geographers of ukraine (change of the program of teaching subjects, the need to prepare new textbooks, significant intensification of public speeches, reorientation in the selection of research sites and conduct scientific and industrial practices, the termination of the use of russian scientists\u2019 publications, the termination of creative relations with russian colleagues, etc.); - significant changes in the personal lives of geographers (changing jobs and places of residence, finding housing for families after moving out of the occupied territories), many specialists experience constant sorrow for the difficult times and longing for the past, among these are often abandoned parents, children, relatives, the feeling of stress that does not go away, activation of volunteer movements and attempts to consolidate the efforts of people of different ages in order to restore the territorial integrity of ukraine and its independent vector of development.",

        "abstract": "in this paper, the relation between language and emotion is discussed by analyzing the language of holocaust victims and survivors. focusing on the role of language in the conceptualization of emotions, it is shown that specific verbal means and structures will reveal much about the nature of emotions in extreme situations. in particular, the metaphoric expressions used in order to express and describe personal feelings disclose characteristics of the underlying emotional structure. texts of the private domain (diaries, memoirs and letters) of holocaust literature show that language is the key point in trying to understand the relation between intense affective processing and the rest of the cognitive life. confronted with degradation, humiliation and elimination, holocaust victims had to cope with extreme emotions. it was extremely difficult to express such emotions. only recently, research within linguistics has begun to analyze the \u201clanguage of the victims\u201d more thoroughly. in this paper, different stages and processes are described concerning the emotional state of holocaust victims and their attempt to document it linguistically: the desperate attempt to cling to a normal life, shifting moments of despair and fear of death mingled with hope and optimism, and the effort to keep and express normal life feelings on the one hand, and on the other hand, the total emotional indifference in order to cope with the horror. it is shown that the distinction between emotions and feelings plays a crucial role in explaining the state of emotional turmoil in which holocaust victims found themselves.",

        "abstract": "north korea is currently a receiver of substantial international economic support, but not for the first time in its history. this article seeks to shed some light on a largely unknown instance of multilateral aid and assistance to north korea provided by the socialist camp in the 1950s. based on research in archives and the analysis of trade data and contemporary media reports, the focus is mainly on the contribution of east germany to the reconstruction of the north korean city of hamh\u00f9ng. it is argued that this relatively well documented and completed case provides a number of highly relevant conclusions for the current, ongoing debate on engagement with north korea. comparing two historically distinct \u201cwaves\u201d of assistance to the same country provides new analytical insights if contrasted with the usual approach of using assistance to a third country as the point of reference. there is evidence that north korea might be applying the same tactics as five decades ago, while the international community faces the danger of repeating old mistakes. moreover, history provides a hitherto underestimated rationale for the nuclear program, one that might require the international community to develop very different strategies from the ones applied so far.",

        "abstract": "why and how did islam become such a political force in so many muslim-majority countries? will it impinge on the political transitions of the arab spring? in this book, jocelyne cesari investigates the relation- ship between modernization and islam in muslim-majority countries such as egypt, iraq, pakistan, tunisia, and turkey \u2013 countries founded by secular rulers that have since undergone secularized politics. cesari argues that nation-building processes in these states have not created western types of regimes, but have instead spurred the politicization of islam by turning it into a modern national ideology. looking closely at examples of islamic dominance in political modernization \u2013 nation- alization of islamic institutions and personnel under state ministries, religiously motivated social unrest or violence, and internationalization of islam-aligned political movements or conlicts \u2013 this study provides a unique overview of the historical and political developments from the end of world war ii to the arab spring that have made islam a dominant political force. it also discusses islam\u2019s impact on emerging democracies in the contemporary middle east and contends that if new democracies emerge, they will probably be unsecular \u2013 that is, limit- ing the rights of the individual on religious grounds. this book offers a unique and original approach to the relationships between religion, politics, and secularism that is also relevant to non-western political experience outside muslim countries.",

        "abstract": "the aim of this article is to set out the various explanations of voting behaviour in turkey. its principal intellectual motivation is to present the political and social indicators that shape voting in such a way as to explain how an activity which is so crucial for democratic life is also based upon voters\u2019 values and surrounding political context. although the number of empirical work on voting behaviour in turkey is increasing there is a considerable room for testing alternative variables and research tools in order to expand the academic knowledge on the problematic. findings ratified that the political and personal values coupled with the other social factors have considerable impact on the voting behaviour in turkey. additionally this research also proved that these factors work differently for the competing political parties. hence the contribution of this study is the introduction of an explicit analysis on the impact of different social and political factors that are salient in voting behaviour and magnitudes of these factors on different political parties by using a public database. thus this study will not only uncover the relevancy of the variables in the literature for turkish voters but also it will highlight the meaning and significance of these factors for different political parties.",

        "abstract": "this paper offers a critical analysis of creeping authoritarianism in bangladesh\u2019s culture and politics. political events since the 1940s that have shaped the presently unstable state of bangladesh\u2019s society are interpreted specifically in terms of their cultural and political significance. one important aspect of this unstable political state is the ongoing search for bangladeshi national identity. accordingly, the paper seeks to answer the questions of why and how the present sociocultural and political divisions in bangladesh have emerged from the fundamental debate over whether (1) bengali ethnicity, language, culture, and secularism, (2) muslim nationalism or (3) a combination of both should become the marker of bangladesh\u2019s national identity to secure social and political stability. furthermore, recent social, religious and political developments across the muslim world suggest that attempts to introduce ultra-secularism in some muslim-majority countries since the 1950s have led to authoritarianism, a movement which has ultimately ended or will soon end through popular islamic upsurges. bangladesh seems to be moving toward such social and political change, as the people have become restless in their desire to remove creeping authoritarian, the mark of a repressive regime that has emerged since the early 1970s. the key lesson that can be drawn from the extant literature on this issue in the context of bangladesh is that the extreme form of secularism or ultra-secularism, which the present ruling awami league and its left-communist allies continue to advance and impose from above, is neither desirable nor acceptable to bangladeshi muslims whilst there is clear movement away from ultra-secularism by other muslim-majority countries. this paper draws the conclusion that since neither assertive secularism nor theocratic islamism can flourish in bangladesh, a competitive democratic political order that accommodates aspects of both secularism and islamic ethical-moral codes could be a feasible model for the achievement of social, cultural and political stability that is so fundamental to the promotion of steady economic growth and social justice.",

        "abstract": "human sacrifice became a common cultural trait during the advanced phases of mesoamerican civilizations. this phenomenon, influenced by complex religious beliefs, included several practices such as decapitation, cranial deformation, and the use of human cranial bones for skull mask manufacturing. archaeological evidence suggests that all of these practices required specialized knowledge of skull base and upper cervical anatomy. the authors conducted a systematic search for information on skull base anatomical and surgical knowledge among mesoamerican civilizations. a detailed exposition of these results is presented, along with some interesting information extracted from historical documents and pictorial codices to provide a better understanding of skull base surgical practices among these cultures. paleoforensic evidence from the great temple of tenochtitlan indicates that aztec priests used a specialized decapitation technique, based on a deep anatomical knowledge. trophy skulls were submitted through a stepwise technique for skull mask fabrication, based on skull base anatomical landmarks. understanding pre-columbian mesoamerican religions can only be realized by considering them in their own time and according to their own perspective. several contributions to medical practice might have arisen from anatomical knowledge emerging from human sacrifice and decapitation techniques.",

        "abstract": "in cadal, there preserve a lot of chinese classical literatures, including graceful prose and verse. these works written in ancient chinese comparatively are concise in vocabulary and sentence patterns. but they express rich feelings and convey a wealth of information. although can be explained in modern chinese, the aesthetic sense in those works disappears. so we aim to illustrate the feeling in these works using chinese traditional music which is also another part of chinese culture. this is an interesting and challenging work. in this paper, the correlation between the text and music is studied. a novel approach is proposed to model the latent semantic association underlying the two medium. based on the correlation model we learned from training data, we can associate a literary work (mainly verse and prose in our digital library) with a few music pieces automatically. when a reader is appreciating a literary work, a piece of background music is playing meanwhile, the information and emotion implied by the work and music blend together. the reader may be immersed into the emotion and obtain aesthetic enjoyment intensively. we implement the proposed method and design experiments to evaluate the performance of it. the experimental result substantiates the feasibility of the proposed approach in this paper.",

        "abstract": "most of modern advertisements contain a song to illustrate the commercial message. the success of a product, and its economic impact, can be directly linked to this choice. finding the most appropriate song is usually made manually. nonetheless, a single person is not able to listen and choose the best music among millions. the need for an automatic system for this particular task becomes increasingly critical. this paper describes the lia music recommendation system for advertisements using both tex-tual and acoustic features. this system aims at providing a song to a given commercial video and was evaluated in the context of the mediaeval 2013 soundtrack task [14]. the goal of this task is to predict the most suitable soundtrack from a list of candidate songs, given a tv commercial. the organizers provide a development dataset including multimedia features. the initial assumption of the proposed system is that commercials which sell the same type of product, should also share the same music rhythm. a twofold system is proposed: find commercials with close subjects in order to determine the mean rhythm of this subset , and then extract, from the candidate songs, the music which better corresponds to this mean rhythm.",

        "abstract": "a challenging open question in music classification is which music representation (i.e., audio features) and which machine learning algorithm is appropriate for a specific music classification task. to address this challenge, given a number of audio feature vectors for each training music recording that capture the different aspects of music (i.e., timbre, harmony, etc.), the goal is to find a set of linear mappings from several feature spaces to the semantic space spanned by the class indicator vectors. these mappings should reveal the common latent variables, which characterize a given set of classes and simultaneously define a multi-class linear classifier that classifies the extracted latent common features. such a set of mappings is obtained, building on the notion of the maximum margin matrix factorization, by minimizing a weighted sum of nuclear norms. since the nuclear norm imposes rank constraints to the learnt mappings, the proposed method is referred to as\u00a0low-rank semantic mappings\u00a0(lrsms). the performance of the lrsms in music genre, mood, and multi-label classification is assessed by conducting extensive experiments on seven manually annotated benchmark datasets. the reported experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the lrsms over the classifiers that are compared to. furthermore, the best reported classification results are comparable with or slightly superior to those obtained by the state-of-the-art task-specific music classification methods.",

        "abstract": "this doctoral research aims to investigate the reputation building process of companies and to examine the applicability of western-developed theories about the uses of corporate reputation in a non-western context. it is the first study that synthesises three theories (value creation, strategic resources and corporate communication) to examine the strategic consequences of the uses of corporate reputation. \r\ncorporate reputation is an attribute or a set of attributes ascribed to a firm and inferred from the firm\u2019s past actions. it is the belief of market participants about a firm\u2019s strategic character (weigelt and camerer, 1988). also, corporate reputation is the public\u2019s cumulative judgement of a firm over time (roberts and dowling, 2002). \r\nthe review of theoretical literature indicates the uses of corporate reputation by business organizations can be theorized along six dominant paradigmatic perspectives: 1-public relations; 2-marketing; 3-management, 4-economic; 5-sociological; 6-finance and accounting. the uses of corporate reputation in these six paradigms are comprehensively discussed. the objective of this study is to establish the use of corporate reputation in the development of brand image strategy. a review of the uses of the concept of corporate reputation is discussed in detail in chapter 2. \r\nthe review of the literature also identified a research gap by showing that scarce research has been conducted on how these three main functions (value creation, strategic resources and corporate communication) affect a company\u2019s brand positioning strategy. the following research question thus is proposed: how do (taiwanese pharmaceutical) companies use their corporate reputation to develop a brand image strategy? \r\nthe research hypotheses based on three theories (value-based theory, resource-based theory and integrated marketing communication theory) appear in chapter 3. the research question is constructed theoretically, and then a conceptual model, which begins with three antecedents of corporate reputation and simultaneously illustrates the outcomes of their use, are discussed. \r\nthe construct of the uses of corporate reputation has three dimensions: value creation, strategic resources and corporate communication. each of these three dimensions includes several items. the items were proposed based on the previous researchers\u2019 summaries and the qualitative interview. the researcher will then depict the proposed research conceptual framework and a number of hypotheses that will be further investigated and tested. \r\nthen the quantative study was completed by providing the data analysis and the results were explained. a multi-stage procedure was involved in this research. first, data examination and screening to prepare for subsequent quantitative analyses and then the descriptive statistics were presented. second, a reliability test was performed on measurement scales to ensure that they achieve an acceptable level of reliability for further analysis. the resulting solutions were then re-assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. finally, pls (partial least squares) was used to test the hypothesized relationships between the research constructs as postulated in the conceptual model, and to assess the overall goodness-of-fit between the proposed model and the collected data set. \r\nthe researcher then discusses the validation of the measurement model and the research findings. the findings are then further discussed in terms of the contribution to marketing theory and relevance to marketing managers. then the items of adapted scales were subjected to several rounds of adjustments and were finally found to possess acceptable measurement properties. reliability and construct validity tests indicated that all scales satisfied widely accepted criteria such as the minimum reliability of 0.7. the results of scale purification will be discussed. and an evaluation of the research hypotheses and their significance are summarized, the findings of all hypotheses testing will be reviewed and compared with previous research. \r\naccording to the research findings, the hypotheses that value creation, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on brand segmentation, brand differentiation and brand positioning are all accepted. the hypotheses that strategic resource, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on brand segmentation and brand differentiation are rejected. however, the hypothesis that strategic resource, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on vii \r\nbrand positioning is accepted. the hypotheses that corporate communication, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on brand segmentation and brand differentiation are both accepted. the hypothesis that corporate communication, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on brand positioning is partially supported. finally, the hypothesis that the (see in table 5.18) moderating effect of price policy on corporate reputation has a positive impact on brand image strategy is partially but negatively supported. \r\nthis thesis makes a significant contribution to the study of corporate reputation of firms in the taiwanese pharmaceutical industry from the robustness of the qualitative and quantitative data collection.",

        "abstract": "it is often assumed that a robust, free and independent media will contribute to the deepening of democracy by keeping governments accountable and broadening citizen participation in deliberative democratic debates. but in new democracies such as south africa, the deepening and broadening of democratic participation is often curtailed by challenges such as unequal access to the media, the orientation of mainstream media towards elite audiences and renewed attempts by sources of power to control the free flow of information. despite the promise of a peaceful, equitable and democratic society after the end of apartheid, conflicts continue to erupt due to continued social polarisation, vast socio-economic inequalities and new struggles for power. in south africa these conflicts include social protests on a daily basis, repeated outbreaks of xenophobic violence and disruptions to the parliamentary process. this paper probes the role of the media in these conflicts from the perspective of journalists who have reported on these issues. the paper explores ways in which journalists critically reflect on their abilities to perform the roles expected of them within a normative framework informed by the habermasian ideal of deliberative democracy. the reasons they offer for not fulfilling these roles, and the conditions underpinning these failures, lead them to question the ability of the south african media to contribute to an emerging democracy.",

        "abstract": "the goal of this thesis is to develop the foundation and structure for a virtue ethics theory grounded in a specific notion of care. while there has been a recent revival of interest in virtue ethics theory, the theory has its roots in aristotle\u2019s work as well in the medieval writings of thomas aquinas. aquinas worked out many of aristotle\u2019s ideas in much more detail. however, while aquinas offers a very rich and compelling ethical theory, it is problematic because it is very tightly wrapped in his theology. a key component in aquinas\u2019s theory is charity. charity is one of aquinas\u2019s theological virtues, which express the relationship between humans and god. charity is the love of god and of neighbor and he construes it as the foundation for all the other virtues. my thesis explores the idea of replacing charity with the virtue of care. the virtue of care to be used in this essential role is primarily based on recent work on the ethics of care by nel nodding. the virtue of care, as i develop it, combines three interrelated parts: instinctive, maternal and relational care. by comparing and contrasting care and charity, i demonstrate that the virtue of care can fill the role of charity. in this capacity care can serve as a naturalistic foundation for a virtue ethics theory. since the ethics of care is relatively new, it has yet to take shape. i propose building a care-based virtue ethics theory on the structure of aquinas\u2019s theory. this new care-based virtue ethics theory also benefits from utilizing many of the components of aristotle\u2019s theory which are found in aquinas\u2019s work. my argument is that care can fulfill the role of charity in \r\naquinas\u2019s theory. care-based virtue ethics theory is a completely naturalistic version of aquinas\u2019s virtue ethics theory. my thesis contains both the foundation for this different kind of care-based virtue ethics theory and some direction for future work on revising aquinas\u2019s theory using the virtue of care. the essence of this care-based virtue ethics theory is captured in the notion i outline of a virtuoso human.",

        "abstract": "an approach founded on virtue ethics has gradually found its way in business ethics (be). despite the field be largely dominated by kantian, utilitarian, and contractualist (rawlsian) theories, a sound virtue-based understanding of be takes concepts such as community, excellence, membership, integrity, and\u00a0phronesis\u00a0as central normative concepts. natural law thinking is traditionally committed with social problems in general and with economic conduct in particular, following specially thomistic teaching. however, notwithstanding the weight of virtues for the aquinas, a relevant part of contemporary thomistic ethics seems to address the problems of be only in terms of moral principles. i contend that the list(s) of basic goods propounded by nnlt is not enough to define a satisfactory\u00a0ethical\u00a0approach \u2013 able to show a desirable way of life for the agents \u2013 because it remains dominated by\u00a0moral\u00a0principles \u2013 which can only show agents their limits of action with regards to others\u2019 freedom. this is especially true for nnlt where the virtue approach is reconceived by theorists such as finnis and grisez in terms of modes of pursuing basic goods or \u201cmodes of responsibility\u201d toward integral human fulfillment. with regard to a virtue-based understanding of be, nnlt emphasis on integral human fulfillment and the modes of responsibility seems to offer only a limited understanding of (business) ethics. it is an understanding in which the \u201cmoral burden\u201d of the modes of responsibility hinders the full potentiality of the virtues in the field of business and management. this is so because the understanding of virtues as modes of responsibility prevents their working as modes of\u00a0personal development of the agent\u00a0within his/her own community of business and, further, prevents someone to work within a business community as an agent who wants to develop his/her talents with a view to the common good of the political community where he/she lives.",

        "abstract": "music is a powerful modality that can bring about changes in individuals of all ages. this research employed both an experimental and quasi-experimental design to identify the effects of music as it influenced psychological well-being, memory, and cognition among older adults. specifically, it addressed three aims: (a) to determine to what extent learning to play a music instrument later in life influenced psychological well-being and cognitive function of non-institutionalized healthy seniors, (b) to determine the effects of the amount of music involvement on psychological well-being and cognitive function (c) to determine the benefit of music for those with limited/no music experience. for the first aim, it was hypothesized that individuals in the experimental music group would maintain and/or improve psychological well-being, memory, and cognitive function more than those assigned to the wait-list control group. for the second aim, it was hypothesized that participants with extensive music involvement would have higher scores on cognitive ability measures and experience greater psychological well-being than those who had not been actively involved in music throughout their life. for the third aim, it was hypothesized that the participants with limited/no music involvement throughout their life would have a larger change on the psychological well-being measures and cognitive assessments than those who had more music involvement. for the experimental portion (aim 1), the study employed a 6-week music intervention with non-institutionalized older adults. the quasi-experimental portion (aims 2 & 3) divided participants according to their amount of time involved in music and then looked at psychological well-being and cognitive function. this dissertation did not show a strong connection between music, memory, and cognition so it did not achieve the desired overall results. however, the findings did suggest that music may modify some areas of cognitive function (verbal learning, memory, and retention) and psychological well-being but did not influence other areas (playing a music instrument for any length of time). therefore, the findings of this dissertation can be a basis upon which future research relating to music, cognitive functioning, psychological well-being and involvement in music can build.",

        "abstract": "in 2002, an article in contraception reported on a trial for a new method of contraception, the standard days method (sdm). sdm is a fertility awareness-based family planning (fp) method that identifies the eighth through nineteenth days of a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle as the fertile window. sdm users abstain or use barrier methods during their fertile periods to prevent pregnancy. the trial established a first-year method failure rate of 5 per 100 woman years with correct use, and 12 per 100 women for typical use. over the decade since the publication of the original efficacy trial, the georgetown university institute for reproductive health and other organizations have introduced and scaled up sdm in a number of countries to expand method access and use for women with unmet contraceptive needs. this working paper reviews the published peer-reviewed and grey literature on sdm from more than a decade of research. the evidence demonstrates the feasibility of integrating sdm into national or subnational fp service delivery, and documents experiences of scaling up sdm in five countries: drc, guatemala, india, mali, and rwanda.",

        "abstract": "introduction:\u00a0in burkina faso, despite several efforts to improve contraceptive uptake, contraceptive prevalence remains low. studies suggest that the low levels of family planning (fp) practices can be partially attributed to the low participation of men in reproductive health programmes. involving men in fp programmes in burkina faso is thus imperative, but the obstacles to this are poorly documented. this study has two objectives to explore the perspectives of men and women on barriers to contraceptive use and to identify the strategies to increase male involvement in family planning.\r\nmethods:\u00a0it is a qualitative study using 20 focus groups and 52 in-depth individual interviews in two regions (north central region and central east region) with a sample of 29 adult men and 23 women who were married and had children or not. interviews were conducted in moore (the national language commonly spoken in both regions). all interviews were recorded and transcribed into french using microsoft word. then, content analysis was carried out using the constant comparison method to identify the major themes.\r\nresults:\u00a0the results show that men\u2019s attitudes are still a significant barrier to women\u2019s use of modern contraceptives. the reasons women do not use contraception and men do not adhere to fp programmes include lack of method knowledge, negative beliefs and perceptions about modern contraceptive methods, and the side effects of contraceptives. cultural norms and preferences for large families are also common barriers to fp. however, the results showed that men\u2019s awareness of fp, communication between spouses, and access to fp services can promote men\u2019s adherence to fp programmes in the centre-east and centre-north regions of burkina faso.\r\nconclusion:\u00a0efforts should be made to improve educational standards, especially for men, and reorient fp services to make them more accessible to men.",

        "abstract": "late pleistocene and holocene climate dynamics along the marginal belt of the east asian summer monsoon in china and their responses to hydrological cycles in lake basins of the tibetan plateau are still a matter of scientific discussion. hala lake, a closed 65\u00a0m deep lake basin in the western qilian mountains, qinghai province, is considered a monitor of climate-driven hydrological and environmental changes during the past 24 kyr bp. the distribution patterns of ostracod assemblages, stable isotopes, sediment\u2013geochemical properties in four sediment records from different water depths and their combination with the unique limnological setting enabled us to reconstruct four major phases of centennial-scale water depth fluctuations from the global last glacial maximum (ca 24 kyr bp) to the present.\r\nour results show that hala lake experienced a very shallow and small water body during the lgm and lateglacial under cold and dry climate conditions. rapid increase of water depth and contemporaneous lake expansion started at around 14 kyr bp (phase i), most likely as a result of glacier melt due to the onset of climate warming. the lake reached >45\u00a0m water depth at around 13.5 kyr bp. reduced water depth during the younger dryas spell (ca 12 kyr bp) may be attributed to a short-term return to cooler and drier conditions. during the early holocene (phase ii), water depth increased further toward lake highstands close to its present level, with a highest lake level of up to 9\u00a0m above the present lakestand at 8.0\u20137.8 kyr bp. besides continued glacier melt supply, we assume that summer monsoon effective moisture contributed to the overall water budget, but remained relatively unstable, favoring water depth fluctuations. a pronounced lower water depth falls into the period between 9.2 and 8.1 kyr bp, perhaps the result of weak monsoon influence or its complete absence, although the warming trend continued toward its optimum at ca 8\u20137 kyr bp. a distinct mass flow, most likely triggered by an earthquake, occurred during a lake lowstand either at ca 7.0 kyr bp or at around 8.1 kyr bp.\r\nthe mid-holocene (phase iii) was characterized by fluctuating water depths between 7.8 and 4.5 kyr bp. conflicting trends of stable isotope data limit the validity of water depth estimations, but may show higher lake levels between 5.5 and 4.5 kyr bp, coincident with dated lake sediments in a cliff position at the northern lake shore. this positive water balance can most likely be attributed to increased westerly-derived moisture supply during autumn and late winter, although summer monsoon influence could also be of significance. coincident with the 4.2 ka event, the lake experienced shallow water at around 4.1 kyr bp, perhaps as a result of continued cooling and drier climate conditions, supporting the arguments of a general cooling trend throughout the holocene.\r\nthe late holocene (phase iv) is characterized by extremely unstable hydrological conditions with rapid fluctuations in water depth, more frequently controlled by westerly-driven effective moisture supply. since the lake lowstand at about 1.4\u20131.2 kyr bp, the lake has developed toward its present level.\r\nour research underlines the necessity for comparing multiple proxy records from different lake sites to better evaluate centennial-scale climate-driven variations throughout the late pleistocene and holocene periods.\r\nall presented data suggest the variable influence of summer monsoon effective moisture on the hydrological budget of the lake. water depth variations did not follow the long-term pattern of the asian monsoon system due to a potential modulation by westerly-derived moisture impact.",

        "abstract": "prehistoric human history on the tibetan plateau is a hotly debated topic. archaeological research on the plateau during the past few decades has enormously improved our understanding of the topic and makes it possible for us to consider the processes and mechanisms of prehistoric human migration to the region. by reviewing the published archaeological research on the tibetan plateau, we propose that the first people on the plateau initially spread into the he-huang region from the chinese loess plateau, and then moved to the low elevation northeastern tibetan plateau and perhaps subsequently to the entire plateau. this process consisted of four stages. (1) during the climatic amelioration of the last deglacial period (15\u201311.6 ka bp), upper paleolithic hunter-gatherers with a developed microlithic technology first spread into the northeastern tibetan plateau. (2) in the early-mid holocene (11.6\u20136 ka bp), epipaleolithic microlithic hunter-gatherers were widely distributed on the northeastern plateau and spread southwards to the interior plateau, possibly with millet agriculture developed in the neighboring low elevation regions. (3) in the mid-late holocene (6\u20134 ka bp), neolithic millet farmers spread into low elevation river valleys in the northeastern and southeastern plateau areas. (4) in the late holocene (4\u20132.3 ka bp), bronze age barley and wheat farmers further settled on the high elevation regions of the tibetan plateau, especially after 3.6 ka bp. finally, we suggest that all of the reported paleolithic sites earlier than the lgm on the tibetan plateau need further examination.",

        "abstract": "numerous pollen records across the upper tibetan plateau indicate that in the early part of the mid-holocene,\u00a0kobresia-rich high-alpine meadows invaded areas formerly dominated by alpine steppe vegetation rich in\u00a0artemisia. we examine climate, land-use, and co2\u00a0concentration changes as potential drivers for this marked vegetation change. the climatic implications of these vegetational shifts are explored by applying a newly developed pollen-based moisture-balance transfer-function to fossil pollen spectra from koucha lake on the north-eastern tibetan plateau (34.0\u00b0n; 97.2\u00b0e; 4540\u00a0m a.s.l.) and xuguo lake on the central tibetan plateau (31.97\u00b0n; 90.3\u00b0e; 4595\u00a0m a.s.l.), both located in the meadow-steppe transition zone. reconstructed moisture-balances were markedly reduced (by \u223c150\u2013180\u00a0mm) during the early mid-holocene compared to the late-holocene. these findings contradict most other records from the indian monsoonal realm and also most non-pollen records from the tibetan plateau that indicate a rather wet early- and mid-holocene. the extent and timing of anthropogenic land-use involving grazing by large herbivores on the upper tibetan plateau and its possible impacts on high-alpine vegetation are still mostly unknown due to the lack of relevant archaeological evidence. arguments against a mainly anthropogenic origin of\u00a0kobresia\u00a0high-alpine meadows are the discovery of the widespread expansion of obviously \u2018natural\u2019\u00a0kobresia\u00a0meadows on the south-eastern tibetan plateau during the lateglacial period indicating the natural origin of this vegetation type and the lack of any concurrence between modern human-driven vegetation shifts and the mid-holocene compositional changes. vegetation types are known to respond to atmospheric co2\u00a0concentration changes, at least on glacial\u2013interglacial scales. this assumption is confirmed by our sensitivity study where we model tibetan vegetation at different co2\u00a0concentrations of 375 (present-day), 260 (early holocene), and 650\u00a0ppm (future scenario) using the biome4 global vegetation model. previous experimental studies confirm that vegetation growing on dry and high sites is particularly sensitive to co2\u00a0changes. here we propose that the replacement of drought-resistant alpine steppes (that are well adapted to low co2\u00a0concentrations) by mesic\u00a0kobresia\u00a0meadows can, at least, be partly interpreted as a response to the increase of co2\u00a0concentration since 7000 years ago due to fertilization and water-saving effects. our hypothesis is corroborated by former co2\u00a0fertilization experiments performed on various dry grasslands and by the strong recent expansion of high-alpine meadows documented by remote sensing studies in response to recent co2\u00a0increases.",

        "abstract": "the transition to the late holocene/neoglacial occurred as a worldwide process of climatic deterioration from the optimum thermal conditions of the mid-holocene, culminating in an abrupt decline around 4200\u00a0cal\u00a0yr ago, in a period of severe climatic deterioration that lasted for two or three centuries. this sudden climatic event has been recorded in many proxy data archives from around the world, and its effects were manifest in different ways depending on the reaction of regional weather systems and conditions, but often as greatly increased aridity and/or cold temperatures. it has been regarded as causing or contributing to the sudden collapse of several well-established human societies at that time, including advanced agricultural late neolithic cultures in eastern china. we have used high-resolution pollen and non-pollen palynomorph analysis to examine the nature of this climatic transition through its impacts on the vegetation and hydrology at pingwang, a site in the yangtze coastal lowlands which has no evidence of complicating environmental influences such as sea-level rise or significant human land-use activity, factors previously suggested as alternative reasons for changes in forest composition. our results show two phases of forest alteration, one gradual from about 5500\u00a0cal bp and one sudden at about 4200\u00a0cal bp., in which the frequencies of subtropical forest elements fall and are replaced by those of conifers and cold-tolerant trees. total arboreal pollen frequencies do not decline and the proportion of temperate forest trees, tolerant of a wide range of temperatures, remains unchanged throughout, both ruling out human land clearance as a cause of the change in forest composition. as these dates accord very well with the known timings of climate deterioration established from other proxy archives in the region, we conclude that climate was the main driver of vegetation change in eastern china at the mid- to late holocene transition. our hydrological results support the view that a combination of rising local water level and climatic cooling during the 4200\u00a0cal bp event was the probable cause of societal collapse in the lower yangtze valley.",

        "abstract": "the study of macrofossils provides a means of reconstructing the expansion, shrinkage and extinction of the key ecological species within a region. in this study, we have used plant macrofossils to examine the species composition of the predominant vegetation in liupan mountains on the southwestern loess plateau in central china. a series of plant macrofossils (wood and needles) was recorded in the tianchi lake, indicating the distinct range changes of one conifer species in this region over the past 6200\u00a0years. further morphological and anatomic analyses of these plant macrofossils, as well as a comparison with current-day needle samples, suggest that they are undoubtedly historical macrofossils of fir trees (possibly originating from species\u00a0abies fargesii). however, no corresponding fir trees are currently found within 100\u00a0km of our study area. the deposited fir needles are highly abundant in sediment between 6200 and 2200\u00a0cal\u00a0yr\u00a0bp. their amount decreases after 2200\u00a0cal\u00a0yr\u00a0bp, and they suddenly disappear after 530\u00a0cal\u00a0yr\u00a0bp. comparison with several types of records (local population data, historical records, fir pollen and stalagmite isotope data) indicates that the decrease and disappearance of the fir trees after 2200\u00a0yr\u00a0bp in this region is associated with increasing anthropogenic activities. these findings suggest that the distribution of fir trees (i.e.\u00a0a. fargesii) were more widespread in china in the past, species of\u00a0a. fargesii\u00a0extended to the liupan mountains. our results further suggest that anthropogenic activities have destroyed the endemic populations of a few key tree species in china. this highlights the necessity of their conservation in the future.",

        "abstract": "the age at which a human environment was made is strongly debated in quaternary science. the perception of the human footprint requires an understanding of the contrast between the present cultural environment and the natural vegetation. this is especially true for high altitude ecosystems, such as the world's largest alpine ecosystem, the 450,000\u00a0km2\u00a0of golf-course-like pastures dominating the southeastern tibetan plateau. this ecosystem is widely considered to be natural, but only because of the unawareness of the effects of grazing management and the incorrect assessment of human signals in palaeo proxies. here we posit the hypothesis that this ecosystem is a human-induced replacement. to test our hypothesis against defined a priori criteria, we 1) monitored vegetation in grazing exclosures; 2) produced floristically complete vegetation records; 3) compared the vegetation records with data of the nearest climate stations; 4) surveyed forest and experimental reforestation trials with endemic tree species; 5) analyzed pollen and re-evaluated published pollen diagrams; and 6) integrated these results with palaeopedological and anthracological results of previous studies. the results of long-term grazing exclosure experiments, the prevalence of grazing-adapted plant functional types, the occurrence of isolated vigorous forests in \u201calpine\u201d pastures, and the successful reforestation trials in presently treeless pastures together suggest that dominant pastures replaced forests in the montane belt and tall grassland in the alpine belt. the spatial and temporal coincidence of palaeosols and archaeological sites with tree species charcoal, the decline in forest pollen during the mid-holocene climatic optimum, and the first appearance of human indicator pollen are most parsimoniously explained by the early presence of foragers and pastoralists. the onset of pastoralism in the tibetan highlands is presumed to date from the 8th millennium bp.",

        "abstract": "fossil pollen from nam co and modern pollen from altitudinal vegetation belts around the lake are investigated to reveal alpine vegetation succession in response to climate changes during the holocene in the central tibetan plateau. the discriminant analysis on 37 topsoil samples shows that pollen samples from alpine steppe at lower elevations (<4800 m) and alpine meadow on upper slopes (4800\u20135200 m) can be distinguished by their pollen assemblages. samples from alpine steppe contain more artemisia (25.1%) and poaceae pollen (11.5%), whereas those from alpine meadow are dominated by cyperaceae pollen (>60%). our result indicates that the pollen ratio of artemisia to cyperaceae (a/cy) can be used as an indicator of the vertical shift of vegetation belts and temperature changes in the central tibetan plateau as suggested by previous studies. a history of the vertical shift of vegetation belts on the northern slope of nyainqentanglha mountains and climate changes since 8.4 kyr bp are thus recovered by 198 fossil pollen assemblages from a 332 cm core of nam co. paleovegetation reconstructed from fossil pollen assemblages through discriminant analysis shows a general downward shift of altitudinal vegetation belts, suggesting a decline in the temperature trend since 8.4 kyr bp. this result is consistent with the reduction of a/cy ratios. the fossil pollen record also reveals warm and wet climate during the early to mid holocene, and cold and dry conditions during the late holocene in the nam co area. a comparison of holocene climatic reconstructions across the plateau indicates that termination of maximum moisture at around 6\u20135.5 kyr bp in our record is associated with the southeastward retreat of the southwest monsoon.",

        "abstract": "climatic and environmental changes in the northeastern tibetan plateau are controlled by the asian summer monsoon (asm) and the westerlies, two key circulation components of the global climate system which directly affect a large human population and associated ecosystems in eastern asia. during the past few decades, a series of holocene palaeoclimatic records have been obtained from sediment cores from lake qinghai and from various other geological archives in the surrounding area of the northeastern tibetan plateau. however, because of uncertainties regarding the sediment chronologies and the climatic significance of the proxies used, the nature of holocene climatic changes in the region remains unclear and even controversial. here we review all major classes of the published data from drilled cores from lake qinghai, as well as other evidence from lakes and aeolian deposits from surrounding areas, in order to reconstruct changes in moisture patterns and possible summer monsoon evolution in the area during the holocene. combining the results of moisture and precipitation proxies such as vegetation history, pollen-based precipitation reconstruction, aeolian activity, lake water depth/lake level changes, salinity and sediment redness, we conclude that moisture and precipitation began to increase in the early holocene, reached their maximum during the middle holocene, and decreased during the late holocene - similar to the pattern of the east asian summer monsoon (easm) in northern china. it is clear that the region experienced a relatively dry climate and weak easm during the early holocene, as indicated by relatively low tree pollen percentages and fluctuating pollen concentrations; generally low lake levels of lake qinghai and the adjacent lake hurleg and lake toson in the qaidam basin; and widely distributed aeolian sand deposition in the lake qinghai basin and the nearby gonghe basin to the south, and in the eastern qaidam basin to the west. we argue that the ostracod \u03b418o record, which is widely used as a proxy of effective moisture and summer monsoon intensity in lake sediments, at least in lake qinghai, and which exhibits light values in the early holocene and heavier values thereafter, cannot be used to reflect the strength of the easm or the intensity of monsoon precipitation - as is also the case for leaf wax \u03b42h records. rather, we argue that as is the case of the chinese speleothem \u03b418o record, which also is often interpreted as an easm proxy, it reflects variation in the \u03b418o of precipitation. overall, we suggest that the easm significantly affected precipitation in the northeastern tibetan plateau during the holocene; and that it increased in strength during the early holocene, reached a maximum during the middle holocene and decreased during the late holocene.",

        "abstract": "estimating vegetation sensitivity during the holocene will improve the predictions of future vegetation dynamics. we compiled 52 pollen sequences from the monsoon-influenced northern china to reconstruct the holocene dynamics of three forest types dominated respectively by\u00a0pinus, quercus\u00a0and\u00a0betula, as well as steppe and desert indicated respectively by\u00a0artemisia\u00a0and chenopodiaceae. the sensitivities of these vegetation types to changes in intensity of the east asian monsoon were calculated according to the elevation, temperature and precipitation groupings of sites. our results show that the holocene vegetation dynamics differed across vegetation types, with\u00a0pinus\u00a0and\u00a0quercus\u00a0at lower elevations more sensitive to monsoon-induced precipitation changes and\u00a0betula\u00a0at higher elevations more sensitive to temperature changes at the beginning of the holocene. we also found an increasing sensitivity for forests and steppe within different groups following evident reduction in monsoon intensity since 5 ka bp, caused most probably by climate drying in this drought-determined forest-steppe in northern china. besides regional scale forest retreat caused by climate drying, elevational movement as well as site expansion and decline are also suggested to explain low vegetation sensitivities in some site-groups. our study provides insights into the mechanisms of individualistic responses of plant taxa as well as the asymmetrical response of ecotonal vegetation to the holocene monsoon development in china.",

        "abstract": "the upper yellow river lies at the margins of and atop the qinghai\u2013tibet plateau. this chapter provides an overview of contemporary understandings of the geography, geology, climate, geomorphology and palaeoenvironments, vegetation, and fauna of the area. tectonic uplift and river incision have induced a wide range of charismatic landscapes, many of which retain a significant imprint from quaternary environmental changes, especially the glaciated mountains, vast lake, river, permafrost, desert and loess landscapes, and countless wetland areas. the plateau is an important alpine biodiversity hot spot. the high elevation, along with prevailing semi-arid/arid climatic conditions and associated vegetation cover, has created distinctive but vulnerable ecosystems. large grassland areas support sparse populations of nomadic herdsmen. mounting evidence suggests that human activities over thousands of years have induced a regime shift from forest cover to grazing-adapted grassland across much of the plateau. in recent decades, population growth has accompanied demands for economic expansion as part of the \u2018great development of the west\u2019 in china. climate change and human activities threaten the landscapes and ecosystems of the upper yellow river. telltale signs of accelerated environmental adjustments include retreating glaciers, melting permafrost, decreasing river flows, shrinking lakes and wetlands, hillslope instability, degrading vegetation, declining grassland productivity, salinity problems, and accelerated desertification. in outlining the structure of this book, this chapter draws attention to three key threads of enquiry: the primacy of landscape diversity and notions of place as an integrative platform for applied research, the importance of field-based understandings alongside remotely sensed applications, and how viewing humans as part of ecosystems helps to shape prospects for more effective approaches to environmental management.",

        "abstract": "yangshao culture is the most important mid-holocene neolithic culture in the yellow river catchment, and thus, a study on the impact of human activities on the environment is important. in the current study, the distribution pattern of the cultivated land in late yangshao culture is reconstructed using gis tool and site domain analysis (sda). the results show that the cultivated land during 5.5\u20135.0 ka bp was mainly distributed in the weihe river valley, luohe river valley, northwestern henan plain, fenhe river valley and eastern gansu region, especially concentrated in the xi\u2019an-baoji line of the weihe river valley. at that time, at least 37,000 km2\u00a0of lands were reclaimed in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river, and 132,000 km2\u00a0of lands were affected by agricultural activities. human activities had become the driving force of land use/land coverage. charcoal records indicate that the ancestors of yangshao culture burnt forests for reclamation, leading to the decrease of arbor pollen at 5 ka bp in core areas of the yangshao culture. the areas that were significantly affected by human activities accounted for 3.2% of the yangshao culture influenced area, while the moderately affected areas accounted for 20.1% of yangshao culture influenced area. meanwhile, 92% of the land areas on the edge and outside of the yangshao culture influenced area were not affected by human activities. the arbor pollen in these areas did not decrease until 4.0 ka bp.",

        "abstract": "among global security regimes, the international human rights regime stands out for its importance\u00a0and\u00a0ineffectiveness. human rights are strongly linked to both international and domestic peace, as well as human security. yet, progress towards guaranteeing even the most basic political, civil and socio-economic rights for all people has been fitful and partial. multilateral efforts, mainly within the un, to promote human rights through standard-setting and voluntary compliance measures have made little difference, especially in the most repressive contexts where it matters most. attempts by the western-led human rights movement to strengthen the regime through policies of naming, shaming, and sanctions have not fared much better, and in fact have often done more harm than good. in this chapter, i critically review the existing international human rights regime and argue, theoretically as well as empirically, for the need to further develop and strengthen a new and complementary approach to promoting human rights. this approach, which i call \u2018principled engagement\u2019, acknowledges the importance in the absence of a central authority or world government of ensuring states\u2019 voluntary compliance with international human rights norms, but seeks to \u2018give teeth\u2019 to the existing multilateral regime through much stronger and deeper engagement on the ground in repressive states. it does not deny the potential usefulness of strong international pressure on repressive states to help create the space for such engagement, but emphasises the advantages of \u2018mediation\u2019 over coercion.",

        "abstract": "coercive diplomacy is a deceivingly attractive strategy. if it can be made to work, it has the potential of achieving foreign policy objectives with considerably fewer costs. but when adopted in unconducive circumstances, the strategy has the potential to backfire and make peaceful resolution of conflicts more difficult. since 2002, when the full scope of iran's nuclear program and ambitions were revealed to the public, the united states has primarily relied on coercive diplomacy to force iran to accept limitations and oversight that go beyond the npt and iran's safeguards agreement. this dissertation assesses how iran's nuclear policy and program has been affected by us and unsc sanctions. it argues that not only has coercive diplomacy failed to persuade iran to accept binding selective constraints on its fuel cycle activities, but it has also triggered a series of reactions that have strengthened iran's determination to advance, enhance, and expand its nuclear fuel cycle program. the findings of this dissertation corroborate the conclusions of most other scholars that have studied coercive diplomacy. indeed, the recurrent failure of coercive diplomacy is rooted in the strategy's neglect of the reality that national-level decisions are the resultant of the pulling and hauling of various forces within the target state and that in dealing with objectionable policies of states, one must seek to weaken the forces that promote and strengthen those that oppose the objectionable policy. in the case of iran, sanctions have done the opposite. they have intensified iranian distrust of the us and the post-war international order and have consequently augmented the forces in iran that promote and have weakened those that oppose iran's nuclear fuel cycle program. taking the factors that drive and shape iran's nuclear policy, this dissertation argues that the proliferation risks of iran's nuclear program could be resolved more quickly, reliably, and effectively through arrangements that are based on mutually acknowledged rights and equitable principles than through arrangements based on coercion.",

        "abstract": "the debate over credit for libya's shift away from \u201crogue state\u201d policies, most especially by settling the pan am 103 lockerbie terrorism case and abandoning its weapons of mass destruction (wmd) programs, is lively politically and challenging analytically. it has important implications for theories of force and diplomacy, particularly coercive diplomacy, and policy debates including such cases as iran and north korea. u.s. coercive diplomacy against libya can be divided into three phases: the reagan strategy of unilateral sanctions and military force, which largely failed; the mixed results from the more multilateral strategy of the george h.w. bush and bill clinton administrations; and the substantial success achieved through the secret direct negotiations initiated along with britain in the latter clinton years and furthered under george w. bush, which culminated in libya closing down its wmd programs. these differences in success and failure are principally explained by (1) the extent of \u201cbalance\u201d in the coercer state's strategy combining credible force and deft diplomacy consistent with three criteria\u2014proportionality, reciprocity, and coercive credibility\u2014taking into account international and domestic constraints; and (2) target state vulnerability as shaped by its domestic politics and economy, particularly whether domestic elites play a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d or \u201ctransmission belt\u201d role in blocking or carrying forward external coercive pressure.",

        "abstract": "the life cycle assessment of the abc (pvt) ltd brick manufacturing plant has considered land use, fossil resource scarcity, water consumption, global warming and fine particulate matter formation as the impact categories for assessment, with clay mining and coal as the input flows with the highest significant contributions to environmental load. the phase of clay mining (65.8%) is significantly impacting on all the investigated impact categories followed by brick moulding (24.8%) and brick roasting (9.4%) phases, respectively. hotspots were assessed to identify potential for resource efficiency and circular economy at abc bricks, zimbabwe. it can be concluded that abc is severely polluting the air with emissions above the environmental management agency (ema) standards for so2, co, pm and nox\u00a0thus putting kiln workers at risk of respiratory diseases. the calculated air quality index (aqi) ranks co as the most affecting pollutant with an average score of \u223c600. clay production efficiency was also determined, and an analysis revealed that extrusion and clamping stage contributed highly to the clay losses during brick moulding. therefore, focus must be placed on these process steps to reduce raw material losses. furthermore, an environmental waste (fly ash) was used in different weight percentage ratios of 10%, 20% and 100% to substitute clay. the increase of the fly ash content in the brick making process proved to significantly reduce the environmental load among the selected impact categories. abc uses clay as its main raw material hence the high demand for clay. strategies should include accounting of used clay daily and raw materials substitution. if abc uses fly ash from its brick kilns and from other thermal power plant boilers to mix with clay in brick production, then the quantity of clay demanded will be reduced. using fly ash will reduce rate of clay extraction while at the same time solving the problem of fly ash disposal in zimbabwe. this circular option will ultimately result in reduced pit expansion, hence reducing top-soil loss and environmental degradation. it should not be disregarded that top-soil loss in turn affects food security. by adopting appropriate technologies, implementing resource efficiency, and designing circular economy patterns, the brick manufacturing sector in zimbabwe may not only reduce production waste but also comply with enforced environmental protection legislation.",

        "abstract": "april 10th 2010 is undoubtedly one of the most important dates in modern polish political history. 96 high polish officials, including president lech kaczynski, died in an airplane crash in smolensk. it can be assumed that this tragedy had a great impact on political attitudes. unfortunately, very few authors in poland conducted empirical research on this topic. the paper addressed the issue of probable psychological consequences of smolensk crash on political attitudes in the light of terror management theory. on this ground it can be said that arousing of mortality awareness after april 10th should result in a widespread feeling of terror. in other words, \u201cthreat of annihilation\u201d should occur as a consequence of recalling those who died in smolensk in the media. one of the major mechanisms to manage such anxiety is construction and maintenance of cultural worldviews, like ideologies. it leads to the hypothesis that when threatened, people are more likely to think and act in accordance with the cultural worldviews they share. political leaders can be seen as guards of these cultural worldviews and if it is so, then trust and support for the politicians should increase when mortality salience occurs. some of the public opinion research conducted in the first days after smolensk crash are used to illustrate this hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "this chapter presents a model that explains the origins of ageism at the individual level among different age groups. the model is based on three theories. terror management theory provides an explanation for the roots and motives of ageism towards old age groups among young and middle-aged groups as well as among the young-old age group. stereotype embodiment theory provides a complementary explanation for self-ageism among the young-old and old-old age groups. finally, social identity theory focuses on the diverse expressions of ageism among different age groups. the model highlights a unique feature of ageism, which, in contrast with other types of prejudice and discrimination, is not directed towards distinct out-groups, but rather towards our future selves by symbolizing a fear of death and its accompanying deterioration. in order to cope with this fear, different age groups differentiate themselves from the old age group by adopting diverse strategies including younger age identities, a distinction between the third and the fourth age, as well as theories like successful and active ageing. because of the gradual reduction of personal and social resources people often encounter in the later stages of life, we suggest some long-term strategies that recognize decline as a valid dimension of ageing and personhood and emphasize alternative resources.",

        "abstract": "it seems likely that awareness of one\u2019s mortality is in some respects advantageous (e.g., because it helps individuals forestall death), but little research has explored the psychological mechanisms that might confer such an advantage. recent research has shown that processing stimuli in terms of survival relevance enhances memory relative to a host of deep-processing conditions, so it is plausible that human memory has been selected to operate more efficiently when death thoughts (e.g., survival concerns) are activated. if so, then the mortality salience as a general psychological state should be sufficient to increase recall; the present experiments show this to be the case. the enhancing effect of mortality salience on recall occurred for both incidental and intentional learning tasks, relative to a variety of comparison conditions, and did not appear to be mediated by affect or arousal. follow-up analyses revealed the effect to be mediated by the complexity of participants\u2019 elaborations about mortality. potential theoretical implications are discussed.",

        "abstract": "several theories about the origins of music have emphasized its biological and social functions, including in courtship. music may act as a courtship display due to its capacity to vary in complexity and emotional content. support for music\u2019s reproductive function comes from the recent finding that only women in the fertile phase of the reproductive cycle prefer composers of complex melodies to composers of simple ones as short-term sexual partners, which is also in line with the ovulatory shift hypothesis. however, the precise mechanisms by which music may influence sexual attraction are unknown, specifically how music may interact with visual attractiveness cues and affect perception and behaviour in both genders. using a crossmodal priming paradigm, we examined whether listening to music influences ratings of facial attractiveness and dating desirability of opposite-sex faces. we also tested whether misattribution of arousal or pleasantness underlies these effects, and explored whether sex differences and menstrual cycle phase may be moderators. our sample comprised 64 women in the fertile or infertile phase (no hormonal contraception use) and 32 men, carefully matched for mood, relationship status, and musical preferences. musical primes (25 s) varied in arousal and pleasantness, and targets were photos of faces with neutral expressions (2 s). group-wise analyses indicated that women, but not men, gave significantly higher ratings of facial attractiveness and dating desirability after having listened to music than in the silent control condition. high-arousing, complex music yielded the largest effects, suggesting that music may affect human courtship behaviour through induced arousal, which calls for further studies on the mechanisms by which music affects sexual attraction in real-life social contexts.",

        "abstract": "objectives\r\nsexual selection typically centers on bodily and psychological traits. non-bodily traits ranging from housing and vehicles through art to social media can, however, influence sexual selection even in absence of the phenotype proper. the theoretical framework of human sexual selection is updated in this article by unifying four theoretical approaches and conceptualizing non-bodily traits as\u00a0extended phenotypic traits.\r\nmethods\r\nexisting research is synthesized with extended phenotype theory, life history theory, and behavioral ecology. to test population-level hypotheses arising from the review, ecological and demographic data on 122 countries are analyzed with multiple linear regression modelling.\r\nresults\r\na four-factor model of intelligence, adolescent fertility, population density, and atmospheric cold demands predicts 64% of global variation in economic complexity in 1995 and 72% of the variation in 2016.\r\nconclusions\r\nthe evolutionary pathways of extended phenotypes frequently undergo a categorical broadening from providing functional benefits to carrying signalling value. extended phenotypes require investments in skills and bioenergetic resources, but they can improve survival in high latitudes, facilitate the extraction of resources from the environment, and substantially influence sexual selection outcomes. bioenergetic investments in extended phenotypes create individual- and population-level tradeoffs with competing life history processes, exemplified here as a global tradeoff between adolescent fertility and economic complexity. the merits of the present model include a more systematic classification of sexual traits, a clearer articulation of their evolutionary-developmental hierarchy, and an analysis of ecological, genetic, and psychological mechanisms that modulate the flow of energy into extended phenotypes and cultural innovations.",

        "abstract": "music is ubiquitous. yet, its biological relevance is still an ongoing debate. supporting the view that music had an ancestral role in\u00a0courtship\u00a0displays, a pilot study presented here provides preliminary evidence on the link between music and sexual selection. the underlying hypothesis is based on the fact that the sexually dimorphic\u00a0neuropeptide\u00a0vasopressin\u00a0has its receptors in the part of the brain involved in music and dance performance (the basal ganglia), and its concentrations rise during sexual arousal in men. in addition, music, dance, and courtship phenotypes seem to be in part regulated by vasopressin and its genes. hence, to test this hypothesis, a rhythmic synchronization task was employed here on one male subject during sexual arousal. results revealed a significant effect of sexual arousal on rhythm synchronization. this is the first report that empirically supports the hypothesis on the role of music in sexual selection. further studies are clearly required.",

        "abstract": "to promote understanding of young people behavioural mechanisms related to health, we evaluated religious attribution, meaning in life, and emotion regulation strategies as predictors of life satisfaction in the sample of 791 religious and non-religious american college students. participants completed religious attribution scale, meaning in life questionnaire, satisfaction with life scale, and the emotion regulation questionnaire. a multiple linear regression revealed that the strongest predictor of life satisfaction for both groups was the presence of meaning in life, followed by the use of cognitive reappraisal. we found that participants with high levels of presence of meaning in life, regardless of their religious identity, were able to benefit from the use of cognitive reappraisal. presence of meaning in life and emotion regulation strategy reside outside of the religious confines, supporting the notion that religiosity is not a singular meaning making system. by identifying constructs related to life satisfaction, we can acquire better understanding of what mechanisms contribute to positive coping strategies that religious and non-religious young adults use to achieve positive life outcomes.",

        "abstract": "the blooming of urban expansion has led to the improvement of urban life, but some of the negative externalities have affected the life quality of urban dwellers, both directly and indirectly. as a result of this, research related to the quality of life has gained much attention among multidisciplinary researchers around the world. a number of attempts have been made by previous researchers to identify, assess, quantify, and map quality of life or well-being under various kinds of perspectives. the objectives of this research were to create a life quality index (lqi) and identify the spatial distribution pattern of lqi in kandy city, sri lanka. multiple factors were decomposed, a hierarchy was constructed by the multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) method, and 13 factors were selected under two main criteria\u2014environmental and socioeconomic. pairwise comparison matrices were created, and the weight of each factor was determined by the analytic hierarchy process (ahp). finally, gradient analysis was employed to examine the spatial distribution pattern of lqi from the city center to the periphery. the results show that socioeconomic factors affect the quality of life more strongly than environmental factors, and the most significant factor is transportation. the highest life quality zones (26% of the total area) were distributed around the city center, while the lowest zones represented only 9% of the whole area. as shown in the gradient analysis, more than 50% of the land in the first five kilometers from the city center comes under the highest life quality zone. this research will provide guidance for the residents and respective administrative bodies to make kandy city a livable city. it the constructed model can be applied to any geographical area by conducting necessary data calibration.",

        "abstract": "a considerable attention has been given recently to the analysis of the temporal dimension(s) of science and the impact of the changes therein on scientific work. one of the questions that has emerged from the rapidly growing discussion is whether and (if so) how these changes affect not only the general structural aspects of scientific practice but also the very content of scientific knowledge. in this study, i critically examine these epistemological considerations in the available body of work on scientific temporality and argue that while there has been significant progress in our understanding of the manifold temporal layers of scientific practice, the analysis of their epistemic impact has remained rather limited in certain aspects. in particular, whereas the recent studies of academic time successfully overcome the binary perspective of \u201cfast versus slow\u201d academia, their considerations of the epistemic role of scientific temporality in particular seem nevertheless still couched in similarly binary terms. against this background, the study explores\u2014in a deliberately speculative fashion\u2014how the available investigations into the temporal structure of science can be progressively utilized and further developed so as to enable an even more complex, nonbinary understanding of the manifold ways in which scientific practice is affected by its temporal conditions. drawing on the contingentism/inevitabilism debate in the contemporary philosophy of science, as well as on andrew pickering\u2019s \u201cmangle\u201d theory of practice, i develop a tentative argument that the temporal structure of scientific work should be perceived as affecting not merely the speed of scientific development\u2014whether negatively or positively\u2014but more importantly also its direction.",

        "abstract": "due to the growing number of ageing reinforced concrete structures such as buildings and bridges, there is an increasing interest in condition assessment and strengthening methods. deterioration processes and demands for higher loads contribute to this interest. if the service life of a structure can be extended by repair and/or strengthening instead of building a new structure, much money can be saved. a strengthening method that has gained increasing acceptance and popularity in recent years is strengthening with fiber reinforced polymer (frp) composites. one common type of frp material is carbon frp (cfrp). \r\nthe frp strengthening system consists of the strengthening material, a frp, and the bonding material, usually an epoxy adhesive. strengthening with frp can generally be divided in two types of techniques: externally bonded sheets/plates and near surface mounted reinforcement (nsmr). the technique of bonding frp sheets/plates externally encompass of bonding the frp onto a prepared surface on a structural member. in the nsmr technique, a longitudinal groove is cut in the surface of a structural element, followed by applying the bonding material into the groove and inserting a frp bar. the most important characteristic of a frp strengthening system is the ability to transfer loads acting on a deficient structural member to the strengthening material. a detrimental event for a strengthened member is failure in the bond region, denoted as debonding. this means failure is occurring prior to the designed or predicted capacity of the strengthened member and must be avoided. \r\nthe behavior of the complete composite system with concrete, adhesive, frp, and internal reinforcement is quite complex. a sophisticated alternative when studying the performance of concrete structural members strengthened with frp is the finite element (fe) method. to properly model the problem at hand, several considerations must be made in a fe analysis: solution procedures, material models, boundary conditions, etc. \r\nthis thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of the behavior of frp strengthened structures in general and nsmr cfrp strengthened concrete members in particular. nonlinear 3d fe analysis is utilized to investigate the behavior of frp strengthened slabs, with and without openings, and two different kinds of bond testing methods: a beam bending test and a nsmr anchorage test. \r\nthe results from the slab tests show that slabs with openings can be strengthened with externally bonded cfrp sheets and the performance is even better than for traditionally steel reinforced slabs. the numerical evaluations show good agreement with the experimental results. \r\nthe results from the beam bending tests indicate that the externally bonded sheet and plate have an effective bond length and that nsmr have an anchorage length larger than tested bond lengths. the numerical results are sensitive to the values of the fracture energy, the tensile strength, and the shape of the softening response for the concrete. \r\nthe results in the nsmr anchorage test show that the failure behavior could be captured and explained only by combining the experimental observations and the fe analysis. the failure mode is a combined failure in the concrete and the adhesive; however, the maximum transferable load is obtained when a major crack at the very end of the bond length is developing in the concrete.",

        "abstract": "this study presents the evolution of travel speeds in the european core road network, between 1960 and 2030. speeds are represented in octilinear cartograms which constitutes one of the novelties of this study. octilinear cartograms have the advantage of simplifying the geographical representation of transport networks, while emphasizing the connections (nodes) and the links between those nodes. the geographical accurateness is no longer important in this type of map; thus, the actual length of links does not correspond to the link's real value, directions are roughly preserved and scale factor is not constant for the entire map. results show a general improvement of speeds in the core network. during the first years of the analysed period, speeds increased in western european countries, while in the latest years, this improvement was extended to peripheral countries. by 2012, travel speeds presented a more homogeneous pattern all over europe, generally ranging between 100 and 110\u2005km/h. this evolution goes all along with a strong eu investment in the trans-european transport road network. in 2030, travel speeds are expected to continue increasing due to the foreseen investments planned by the european commission.",
